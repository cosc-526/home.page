makes of me that i have much ado to know myself believe me no i thank my fortune for it my ventures are not in one bottom trusted nor to one place nor is my whole estate upon the fortune of this present year therefore my merchandise makes me not sad fie fie your worth is very dear in my regard i take it your own business calls on you and you embrace the occasion to depart i hold the world but as the world gratiano a stage where every man must play a part and mine a sad one farewell ill grow a talker for this gear is that any thing now well tell me now what lady is the same to whom you swore a secret pilgrimage that you today promised to tell me of i pray you good bassanio let me know it and if it stand as you yourself still do within the eye of honour be assured my purse my person my extremest means lie all unlockd to your occasions you know me well and herein spend but time to wind about my love with circumstance and out of doubt you do me now more wrong in making question of my uttermost than if you had made waste of all i have then do but say to me what i should do that in your knowledge may by me be done and i am prest unto it therefore speak thou knowst that all my fortunes are at sea neither have i money nor commodity to raise a present sum therefore go forth try what my credit can in venice do that shall be rackd even to the uttermost to furnish thee to belmont to fair portia go presently inquire and so will i where money is and i no question make to have it of my trust or for my sake   scene ii belmont a room in portias house shylock although i neither lend nor borrow by taking nor by giving of excess yet to supply the ripe wants of my friend ill break a custom is he yet possessd how much ye would and for three months i do never use it and what of him did he take interest this was a venture sir that jacob served for a thing not in his power to bring to pass but swayd and fashiond by the hand of heaven was this inserted to make interest good or is your gold and silver ewes and rams mark you this bassanio the devil can cite scripture for his purpose an evil soul producing holy witness is like a villain with a smiling cheek a goodly apple rotten at the heart o what a goodly outside falsehood hath well shylock shall we be beholding to you i am as like to call thee so again to spit on thee again to spurn thee too if thou wilt lend this money lend it not as to thy friends for when did friendship take a breed for barren metal of his friend but lend it rather to thine enemy who if he break thou mayst with better face exact the penalty content i faith ill seal to such a bond and say there is much kindness in the jew why fear not man i will not forfeit it within these two months thats a month before this bond expires i do expect return of thrice three times the value of this bond yes shylock i will seal unto this bond hie thee gentle jew   the hebrew will turn christian he grows kind come on in this there can be no dismay my ships come home a month before the day whos there fie fie gratiano where are all the rest tis nine oclock our friends all stay for you no masque tonight the wind is come about bassanio presently will go aboard i have sent twenty out to seek for you hear me yet good shylock i pray thee hear me speak let him alone ill follow him no more with bootless prayers he seeks my life his reason well i know i oft deliverd from his forfeitures many that have at times made moan to me therefore he hates me the duke cannot deny the course of law for the commodity that strangers have with us in venice if it be denied will much impeach the justice of his state since that the trade and profit of the city consisteth of all nations therefore go these griefs and losses have so bated me that i shall hardly spare a pound of flesh tomorrow to my bloody creditor well gaoler on pray god bassanio come to see me pay his debt and then i care not ready so please your grace i have heard your grace hath taen great pains to qualify his rigorous course but since he stands obdurate and that no lawful means can carry me out of his envys reach i do oppose my patience to his fury and am armd to suffer with a quietness of spirit the very tyranny and rage of his i pray you think you question with the jew you may as well go stand upon the beach and bid the main flood bate his usual height you may as well use question with the wolf why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb you may as well forbid the mountain pines to wag their high tops and to make no noise when they are fretten with the gusts of heaven you may as well do anything most hard as seek to soften thatthan which whats harder his jewish heart therefore i do beseech you make no more offers use no farther means but with all brief and plain conveniency let me have judgment and the jew his will i am a tainted wether of the flock meetest for death the weakest kind of fruit drops earliest to the ground and so let me you cannot better be employd bassanio than to live still and write mine epitaph ay so he says i do most heartily i do beseech the court to give the judgment but little i am armd and well prepared give me your hand bassanio fare you well grieve not that i am fallen to this for you for herein fortune shows herself more kind than is her custom it is still her use to let the wretched man outlive his wealth to view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow an age of poverty from which lingering penance of such misery doth she cut me off commend me to your honourable wife tell her the process of antonios end say how i loved you speak me fair in death and when the tale is told bid her be judge whether bassanio had not once a love repent but you that you shall lose your friend and he repents not that he pays your debt for if the jew do cut but deep enough ill pay it presently with all my heart so please my lord the duke and all the court to quit the fine for one half of his goods i am content so he will let me have the other half in use to render it upon his death unto the gentleman that lately stole his daughter two things provided more that for this favour he presently become a christian the other that he do record a gift here in the court of all he dies possessd unto his son lorenzo and his daughter and stand indebted over and above in love and service to you evermore my lord bassanio let him have the ring let his deservings and my love withal be valued against your wifes commandment no more than i am well acquitted of i am the unhappy subject of these quarrels i once did lend my body for his wealth which but for him that had your husbands ring had quite miscarried i dare be bound again my soul upon the forfeit that your lord will never more break faith advisedly here lord bassanio swear to keep this ring i am dumb sweet lady you have given me life and living for here i read for certain that my ships are safely come to roadyour mind is tossing on the ocean there where your argosies with portly sail like signiors and rich burghers on the flood or as it were the pageants of the sea do overpeer the petty traffickers that curtsy to them do them reverence as they fly by them with their woven wings my wind cooling my broth would blow me to an ague when i thought what harm a wind too great at sea might do i should not see the sandy hourglass run but i should think of shallows and of flats and see my wealthy andrew dockd in sand vailing her hightop lower than her ribs to kiss her burial should i go to church and see the holy edifice of stone and not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks which touching but my gentle vessels side would scatter all her spices on the stream enrobe the roaring waters with my silks and in a word but even now worth this and now worth nothing shall i have the thought to think on this and shall i lack the thought that such a thing bechanced would make me sad but tell not me i know antonio is sad to think upon his merchandise why then you are in love not in love neither then let us say you are sad because you are not merry and twere as easy for you to laugh and leap and say you are merry because you are not sad now by twoheaded janus nature hath framed strange fellows in her time some that will evermore peep through their eyes and laugh like parrots at a bagpiper and other of such vinegar aspect that theyll not show their teeth in way of smile though nestor swear the jest be laughable i would have stayd till i had made you merry if worthier friends had not prevented me good morrow my good lords well make our leisures to attend on yours we have not spoke us yet of torchbearers tis good we do so his hour is almost past o ten times faster venus pigeons fly to seal loves bonds newmade than they are wont to keep obliged faith unforfeited here comes lorenzo more of this hereafter why man i saw bassanio under sail with him is gratiano gone along and in their ship i am sure lorenzo is not he came too late the ship was under sail but there the duke was given to understand that in a gondola were seen together lorenzo and his amorous jessica besides antonio certified the duke they were not with bassanio in his ship why all the boys in venice follow him crying his stones his daughter and his ducats marry well rememberd i reasond with a frenchman yesterday who told me in the narrow seas that part the french and english there miscarried a vessel of our country richly fraught i thought upon antonio when he told me and wishd in silence that it were not his a kinder gentleman treads not the earth i saw bassanio and antonio part bassanio told him he would make some speed of his return he answerd do not so slubber not business for my sake bassanio but stay the very riping of the time and for the jews bond which he hath of me let it not enter in your mind of love be merry and employ your chiefest thoughts to courtship and such fair ostents of love as shall conveniently become you there and even there his eye being big with tears turning his face he put his hand behind him and with affection wondrous sensible he wrung bassanios hand and so they parted do we so why yet it lives there uncheckd that antonio hath a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas the goodwins i think they call the place a very dangerous flat and fatal where the carcasses of many a tall ship lie buried as they say if my gossip report be an honest woman of her word come the full stop i would it might prove the end of his losses thats certain i for my part knew the tailor that made the wings she flew withal there is more difference between thy flesh and hers than between jet and ivory more between your bloods than there is between red wine and rhenish but tell us do you hear whether antonio have had any loss at sea or no why i am sure if he forfeit thou wilt not take his flesh whats that good for we have been up and down to seek him it is the most impenetrable cur that ever kept with men i am sure the duke will never grant this forfeiture to holdbelieve me sir had i such venture forth the better part of my affections would be with my hopes abroad i should be still plucking the grass to know where sits the wind peering in maps for ports and piers and roads and every object that might make me fear misfortune to my ventures out of doubt would make me sad here comes bassanio your most noble kinsman gratiano and lorenzo fare ye well we leave you now with better company tis vile unless it may be quaintly orderd and better in my mind not undertook ay marry ill be gone about it straight and so will i the villain jew with outcries raised the duke who went with him to search bassanios ship i never heard a passion so confused so strange outrageous and so variable as the dog jew did utter in the streets my daughter o my ducats o my daughter fled with a christian o my christian ducats justice the law my ducats and my daughter a sealed bag two sealed bags of ducats of double ducats stolen from me by my daughter and jewels two stones two rich and precious stones stolen by my daughter justice find the girl she hath the stones upon her and the ducats let good antonio look he keep his day or he shall pay for this you were best to tell antonio what you hear yet do not suddenly for it may grieve him i think he only loves the world for him i pray thee let us go and find him out and quicken his embraced heaviness with some delight or other now what news on the rialto i would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she wept for the death of a third husband but it is true without any slips of prolixity or crossing the plain highway of talk that the good antonio the honest antonioo that i had a title good enough to keep his name company ha what sayest thou why the end is he hath lost a ship let me say amen betimes lest the devil cross my prayer for here he comes in the likeness of a jew   how now shylock what news among the merchants and shylock for his own part knew the bird was fledged and then it is the complexion of them all to leave the dam thats certain if the devil may be her judge out upon it old carrion rebels it at these years here comes another of the tribe a third cannot be matched unless the devil himself turn jewgood signiors both when shall we laugh say when you grow exceeding strange must it be so i will not fail you gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing more than any man in all venice his reasons are as two grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff you shall seek all day ere you find them and when you have them they are not worth the search tis not unknown to you antonio how much i have disabled mine estate by something showing a more swelling port than my faint means would grant continuance nor do i now make moan to be abridged from such a noble rate but my chief care is to come fairly off from the great debts wherein my time something too prodigal hath left me gaged to you antonio i owe the most in money and in love and from your love i have a warranty to unburden all my plots and purposes how to get clear of all the debts i owe in my schooldays when i had lost one shaft i shot his fellow of the selfsame flight the selfsame way with more advised watch to find the other forth and by adventuring both i oft found both i urge this childhood proof because what follows is pure innocence i owe you much and like a wilful youth that which i owe is lost but if you please to shoot another arrow that self way which you did shoot the first i do not doubt as i will watch the aim or to find both or bring your latter hazard back again and thankfully rest debtor for the first in belmont is a lady richly left and she is fair and fairer than that word of wondrous virtues sometimes from her eyes i did receive fair speechless messages her name is portia nothing undervalued to catos daughter brutus portia nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth for the four winds blow in from every coast renowned suitors and her sunny locks hang on her temples like a golden fleece which makes her seat of belmont colchos strand and many jasons come in quest of her o my antonio had i but the means to hold a rival place with one of them i have a mind presages me such thrift that i should questionless be fortunate ay sir for three months for the which as i told you antonio shall be bound may you stead me will you pleasure me shall i know your answer your answer to that have you heard any imputation to the contrary be assured you may if it please you to dine with us this is signior antonio shylock do you hear this were kindness you shall not seal to such a bond for me ill rather dwell in my necessity i like not fair terms and a villains mind you may do so but let it be so hasted that supper be ready at the farthest by five of the clock see these letters delivered put the liveries to making and desire gratiano to come anon to my lodging gramercy wouldst thou aught with me one speak for both what would you i know thee well thou hast obtaind thy suit shylock thy master spoke with me this day and hath preferrd thee if it be preferment to leave a rich jews service to become the follower of so poor a gentleman thou speakst it well go father with thy son take leave of thy old master and inquire my lodging out give him a livery more guarded than his fellows see it done i pray thee good leonardo think on this these things being bought and orderly bestowd return in haste for i do feast tonight my bestesteemd acquaintance hie thee go gratiano you have obtaind it why then you must but hear thee gratiano thou art too wild too rude and bold of voice parts that become thee happily enough and in such eyes as ours appear not faults but where thou art not known why there they show something too liberal pray thee take pain to allay with some cold drops of modesty thy skipping spirit lest through thy wild behavior i be misconstrued in the place i go to and lose my hopes well we shall see your bearing no that were pity i would entreat you rather to put on your boldest suit of mirth for we have friends that purpose merriment but fare you well i have some business let me choose for as i am i live upon the rack none but that ugly treason of mistrust which makes me fear the enjoying of my love there may as well be amity and life tween snow and fire as treason and my love promise me life and ill confess the truth confess and love had been the very sum of my confession o happy torment when my torturer doth teach me answers for deliverance but let me to my fortune and the caskets so may the outward shows be least themselves the world is still deceived with ornament in law what plea so tainted and corrupt but being seasoned with a gracious voice obscures the show of evil in religion what damned error but some sober brow will bless it and approve it with a text hiding the grossness with fair ornament there is no vice so simple but assumes some mark of virtue on his outward parts how many cowards whose hearts are all as false as stairs of sand wear yet upon their chins the beards of hercules and frowning mars who inward searchd have livers white as milk and these assume but valours excrement to render them redoubted look on beauty and you shall see tis purchased by the weight which therein works a miracle in nature making them lightest that wear most of it so are those crisped snaky golden locks which make such wanton gambols with the wind upon supposed fairness often known to be the dowry of a second head the skull that bred them in the sepulchre thus ornament is but the guiled shore to a most dangerous sea the beauteous scarf veiling an indian beauty in a word the seeming truth which cunning times put on to entrap the wisest therefore thou gaudy gold hard food for midas i will none of thee nor none of thee thou pale and common drudge tween man and man but thou thou meagre lead which rather threatenest than dost promise aught thy paleness moves me more than eloquence and here choose i joy be the consequence what find i here   fair portias counterfeit what demigod hath come so near creation move these eyes or whether riding on the balls of mine seem they in motion here are severd lips parted with sugar breath so sweet a bar should sunder such sweet friends here in her hairs the painter plays the spider and hath woven a golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men faster than gnats in cobwebs but her eyes how could he see to do them having made one methinks it should have power to steal both his and leave itself unfurnishd yet look how far the substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow in underprizing it so far this shadow doth limp behind the substance heres the scroll the continent and summary of my fortune   you that choose not by the view chance as fair and choose as true since this fortune falls to you be content and seek no new if you be well pleased with this and hold your fortune for your bliss turn you where your lady is and claim her with a loving kiss a gentle scroll fair lady by your leave i come by note to give and to receive like one of two contending in a prize that thinks he hath done well in peoples eyes hearing applause and universal shout giddy in spirit still gazing in a doubt whether these pearls of praise be his or no so thrice fair lady stand i even so as doubtful whether what i see be true until confirmd signd ratified by you madam you have bereft me of all words only my blood speaks to you in my veins and there is such confusion in my powers as after some oration fairly spoke by a beloved prince there doth appear among the buzzing pleased multitude where every something being blent together turns to a wild of nothing save of joy expressd and not expressd but when this ring parts from this finger then parts life from hence o then be bold to say bassanios dead with all my heart so thou canst get a wife and do you gratiano mean good faith

like the lord bassanios wife even such a husband hast thou of me as she is for a wife i will anon first let us go to dinner no pray thee let it serve for tabletalk then howsoer thou speakst mong other things i shall digest it the moon shines bright in such a night as this when the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees and they did make no noise in such a night troilus methinks mounted the troyan walls and sighd his soul toward the grecian tents where cressid lay that night in such a night stood dido with a willow in her hand upon the wild sea banks and waft her love to come again to carthage in such a night did jessica steal from the wealthy jew and with an unthrift love did run from venice as far as belmont in such a night did pretty jessica like a little shrew slander her love and he forgave it her who comes so fast in silence of the night a friend what friend your name i pray you friend who comes with her he is not nor we have not heard from him but go we in i pray thee jessica and ceremoniously let us prepare some welcome for the mistress of the house who calls leave hollaing man here here sweet soul lets in and there expect their coming and yet no matter why should we go in my friend stephano signify i pray you within the house your mistress is at hand and bring your music forth into the air   how sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank here will we sit and let the sounds of music creep in our ears soft stillness and the night become the touches of sweet harmony sit jessica look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold theres not the smallest orb which thou beholdst but in his motion like an angel sings still quiring to the youngeyed cherubins such harmony is in immortal souls but whilst this muddy vesture of decay doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it   come ho and wake diana with a hymn with sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear and draw her home with music the reason is your spirits are attentive for do but note a wild and wanton herd or race of youthful and unhandled colts fetching mad bounds bellowing and neighing loud which is the hot condition of their blood if they but hear perchance a trumpet sound or any air of music touch their ears you shall perceive them make a mutual stand their savage eyes turnd to a modest gaze by the sweet power of music therefore the poet did feign that orpheus drew trees stones and floods since nought so stockish hard and full of rage but music for the time doth change his nature the man that hath no music in himself nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds is fit for treasons stratagems and spoils the motions of his spirit are dull as night and his affections dark as erebus let no such man be trusted mark the music that is the voice or i am much deceived of portia dear lady welcome home madam they are not yet but there is come a messenger before to signify their coming your husband is at hand i hear his trumpet we are no telltales madam fear you not fair ladies you drop manna in the way of starved peopleyou look not well signior antonio you have too much respect upon the world they lose it that do buy it with much care believe me you are marvellously changed let me play the fool with mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come and let my liver rather heat with wine than my heart cool with mortifying groans why should a man whose blood is warm within sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice by being peevish i tell thee what antonio i love thee and it is my love that speaks there are a sort of men whose visages do cream and mantle like a standing pond and do a wilful stillness entertain with purpose to be dressd in an opinion of wisdom gravity profound conceit as who should say i am sir oracle and when i ope my lips let no dog bark o my antonio i do know of these that therefore only are reputed wise for saying nothing when i am very sure if they should speak would almost damn those ears which hearing them would call their brothers fools ill tell thee more of this another time but fish not with this melancholy bait for this fool gudgeon this opinion come good lorenzo fare ye well awhile ill end my exhortation after dinner well keep me company but two years moe thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue thanks i faith for silence is only commendable in a neats tongue dried and a maid not vendible where is your master signior bassanio i have a suit to you you must not deny me i must go with you to belmont signior bassanio hear me if i do not put on a sober habit talk with respect and swear but now and then wear prayerbooks in my pocket look demurely nay more while grace is saying hood mine eyes thus with my hat and sigh and say amen use all the observance of civility like one well studied in a sad ostent to please his grandam never trust me more nay but i bar tonight you shall not gauge me by what we do tonight and i must to lorenzo and the rest but we will visit you at suppertime we have not made good preparation lovenews in faith was not that letter from fair jessica this is the penthouse under which lorenzo desired us to make stand and it is marvel he outdwells his hour for lovers ever run before the clock that ever holds who riseth from a feast with that keen appetite that he sits down where is the horse that doth untread again his tedious measures with the unbated fire that he did pace them first all things that are are with more spirit chased than enjoyd how like a younker or a prodigal the scarfed bark puts from her native bay huggd and embraced by the strumpet wind how like the prodigal doth she return with overweatherd ribs and ragged sails lean rent and beggard by the strumpet wind now by my hood a gentile and no jew signior antonio i am glad ont i desire no more delight than to be under sail and gone tonight my lord bassanio and my gentle lady i wish you all the joy that you can wish for i am sure you can wish none from me and when your honours mean to solemnize the bargain of your faith i do beseech you even at that time i may be married too i thank your lordship you have got me one my eyes my lord can look as swift as yours you saw the mistress i beheld the maid you loved i loved for intermission no more pertains to me my lord than you your fortune stood upon the casket there and so did mine too as

bring thee to the gallows not the font fair sir you are well oertaen my lord bassanio upon more advice hath sent you here this ring and doth entreat your company at dinner that will i do to nerissa  by yonder moon i swear you do me wrong in faith i gave it to the judges clerk would he were gelt that had it for my part since you do take it love so much at heart about a hoop of gold a paltry ring that she did give me whose posy was for all the world like cutlers poetry upon  a knife love me and leave me not he will an if he live to be a man now by this hand i gave it to a youth a kind of boy a little scrubbed boy no higher than thyself the judges clerk a prating boy that beggd it as a fee i could not for my heart deny it him my lord bassanio gave his ring away unto the judge that beggd it and indeed deserved it too and then the boy his clerk that took some pains in writing he beggd mine and neither man nor master would take aught but the two rings well do you so let not me take him then for if i do ill mar the young clerks pen why this is like the mending of highways in summer where the ways are fair enough what are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold let it be so the first intergatory that my nerissa shall be sworn on is whether till the next night she had rather stay or go to bed now being two hours to day but were the day come i should wish it dark that i were couching with the doctors clerk well while i live ill fear no other thing so sore as keeping safe nerissas ringby my troth nerissa my little body is aweary of this great world good sentences and well pronounced if to do were as easy as to know what were good to do chapels had been churches and poor mens cottages princes palaces it is a good divine that follows his own instructions i can easier teach twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow mine own teaching the brain may devise laws for the blood but a hot temper leaps oer a cold decree such a hare is madness the youth to skip oer the meshes of good counsel the cripple but this reasoning is not in the fashion to choose me a husband o me the word choose i may neither choose whom i would nor refuse whom i dislike so is the will of a living daughter curbed by the will of a dead father is it not hard nerissa that i cannot choose one nor refuse none i pray thee overname them and as thou namest them i will describe them and according to my description level at my affection ay thats a colt indeed for he doth nothing but talk of his horse and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts that he can shoe him himself i am much afeard my lady his mother played false with a smith he doth nothing but frown as who should say if you will not have me choose he hears merry tales and smiles not i fear he will prove the weeping philosopher when he grows old being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth i had rather be married to a deathshead with a bone in his mouth than to either of these god defend me from these two god made him and therefore let him pass for a man in truth i know it is a sin to be a mocker but he why he hath a horse better than the neapolitans a better bad habit of frowning than the count palatine he is every man in no man if a throstle sing he falls straight a capering he will fence with his own shadow if i should marry him i should marry twenty husbands if he would despise me i would forgive him for if he love me to madness i shall never requite him you know i say nothing to him for he understands not me nor i him he hath neither latin french nor italian and you will come into the court and swear that i have a poor pennyworth in the english he is a proper mans picture but alas who can converse with a dumbshow how oddly he is suited i think he bought his doublet in italy his round hose in france his bonnet in germany and his behavior every where that he hath a neighbourly charity in him for he borrowed a box of the ear of the englishman and swore he would pay him again when he was able i think the frenchman became his surety and sealed under for another very vilely in the morning when he is sober and most vilely in the afternoon when he is drunk when he is best he is a little worse than a man and when he is worst he is little better than a beast and the worst fall that ever fell i hope i shall make shift to go without him therefore for fear of the worst i pray thee set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket for if the devil be within and that temptation without i know he will choose it i will do any thing nerissa ere ill be married to a sponge if i live to be as old as sibylla i will die as chaste as diana unless i be obtained by the manner of my fathers will i am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable for there is not one among them but i dote on his very absence and i pray god grant them a fair departure yes yes it was bassanio as i think he was so called i remember him well and i remember him worthy of thy praise   how now what news if i could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart as i can bid the other four farewell i should be glad of his approach if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil i had rather he should shrive me than wive me come nerissa sirrah go before whiles we shut the gates upon one wooer another knocks at the door in terms of choice i am not solely led by nice direction of a maidens eyes besides the lottery of my destiny bars me the right of voluntary choosing but if my father had not scanted me and hedged me by his wit to yield myself his wife who wins me by that means i told you yourself renowned prince then stood as fair as any comer i have lookd on yet for my affection you must take your chance and either not attempt to choose at all or swear before you choose if you choose wrong never to speak to lady afterward in way of marriage therefore be advised first forward to the temple after dinner your hazard shall be made go draw aside the curtains and discover the several caskets to this noble prince now make your choice the one of them contains my picture prince if you choose that then i am yours withal there take it prince and if my form lie there then i am yours a gentle riddance draw the curtains go let all of his complexion choose me so behold there stand the caskets noble prince if you choose that wherein i am containd straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized but if you fail without more speech my lord you must be gone from hence immediately to these injunctions every one doth swear that comes to hazard for my worthless self too long a pause for that which you find there to offend and judge are distinct offices and of opposed natures thus hath the candle singed the moth o these deliberate fools when they do choose they have the wisdom by their wit to lose come draw the curtain nerissa here what would my lord no more i pray thee i am half afeard thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee thou spendst such highday wit in praising him come come nerissa for i long to see quick cupids post that comes so mannerly i pray you tarry pause a day or two before you hazard for in choosing wrong i lose your company therefore forbear awhile theres something tells me but it is not love i would not lose you and you know yourself hate counsels not in such a quality but lest you should not understand me well and yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought i would detain you here some month or two before you venture for me i could teach you how to choose right but i am then forsworn so will i never be so may you miss me but if you do youll make me wish a sin that i had been forsworn beshrew your eyes they have oerlookd me and divided me one half of me is yours the other half yours mine own i would say but if mine then yours and so all yours o these naughty times put bars between the owners and their rights and so though yours not yours prove it so let fortune go to hell for it not i i speak too long but tis to peize the time to eke it and to draw it out in length to stay you from election upon the rack bassanio then confess what treason there is mingled with your love ay but i fear you speak upon the rack where men enforced do speak anything well then confess and live away then i am lockd in one of them if you do love me you will find me out nerissa and the rest stand all aloof let music sound while he doth make his choice then if he lose he makes a swanlike end fading in music that the comparison may stand more proper my eye shall be the stream and watery deathbed for him he may win and what is music then then music is even as the flourish when true subjects bow to a newcrowned monarch such it is as are those dulcet sounds in break of day that creep into the dreaming bridegrooms ear and summon him to marriage now he goes with no less presence but with much more love than young alcides when he did redeem the virgin tribute paid by howling troy to the seamonster i stand for sacrifice the rest aloof are the dardanian wives with bleared visages come forth to view the issue of the exploit go hercules live thou i live with much much more dismay i view the fight than thou that makest the fray   song tell me where is fancy bred or in the heart or in the head how begot how nourished reply reply it is engenderd in the eyes with gazing fed and fancy dies in the cradle where it lies let us all ring fancys knell ill begin itding dong bell aside  how all the other passions fleet to air as doubtful thoughts and rashembraced despair and shuddering fear and greeneyed jealousy o love be moderate allay thy ecstasy in measure rein thy joy scant this excess i feel too much thy blessing make it less for fear i surfeit you see me lord bassanio where i stand such as i am though for myself alone i would not be ambitious in my wish to wish myself much better yet for you i would be trebled twenty times myself a thousand times more fair ten thousand times more rich that only to stand high in your account i might in virtue beauties livings friends exceed account but the full sum of me is sum of something which to term in gross is an unlessond girl unschoold unpractised happy in this she is not yet so old but she may learn happier than this she is not bred so dull but she can learn happiest of all is that her gentle spirit commits itself to yours to be directed as from her lord her governor her king myself and what is mine to you and yours is now converted but now i was the lord of this fair mansion master of my servants queen oer myself and even now but now this house these servants and this same myself are yours my lord i give them with this ring which when you part from lose or give away let it presage the ruin of your love and be my vantage to exclaim on you is this true nerissa so do i my lord they are entirely welcome there are some shrewd contents in yon same paper that steals the colour from bassanios cheek some dear friend dead else nothing in the world could turn so much the constitution of any constant man what worse and worse with leave bassanio i am half yourself and i must freely have the half of anything that this same paper brings you is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble what sum owes he the jew what no more pay him six thousand and deface the bond double six thousand and then treble that before a friend of this description shall lose a hair through bassanios fault first go with me to church and call me wife and then away to venice to your friend for never shall you lie by portias side with an unquiet soul you shall have gold to pay the petty debt twenty times over when it is paid bring your true friend along my maid nerissa and myself meantime will live as maids and widows come away for you shall hence upon your weddingday bid your friends welcome show a merry cheer since you are dear bought i will love you dear but let me hear the letter of your friend o love dispatch all business and be gone i never did repent for doing good nor shall not now for in companions that do converse and waste the time together whose souls do bear an equal yoke of love there must be needs a like proportion of lineaments of manners and of spirit which makes me think that this antonio being the bosom lover of my lord must needs be like my lord if it be so how little is the cost i have bestowd in purchasing the semblance of my soul from out the state of hellish misery this comes too near the praising of myself therefore no more of it hear other things lorenzo i commit into your hands the husbandry and manage of my house until my lords return for mine own part i have toward heaven breathed a secret vow to live in prayer and contemplation only attended by nerissa here until her husband and my lords return there is a monastery two miles off and there will we abide i do desire you not to deny this imposition the which my love and some necessity now lays upon you my people do already know my mind and will acknowledge you and jessica in place of lord bassanio and myself and so farewell till we shall meet again i thank you for your wish and am well pleased to wish it back on you fare you well jessica   now balthasar as i have ever found thee honesttrue so let me find thee still take this same letter and use thou all the endeavour of a man in speed to padua see thou render this into my cousins hand doctor bellario and look what notes and garments he doth give thee bring them i pray thee with imagined speed unto the tranect to the common ferry which trades to venice waste no time in words but get thee gone i shall be there before thee come on nerissa i have work in hand that you yet know not of well see our husbands before they think of us they shall nerissa but in such a habit that they shall think we are accomplished with that we lack ill hold thee any wager when we are both accoutred like young men ill prove the prettier fellow of the two and wear my dagger with the braver grace and speak between the change of man and boy with a reed voice and turn two mincing steps into a manly stride and speak of frays like a fine bragging youth and tell quaint lies how honourable ladies sought my love which i denying they fell sick and died i could not do withal then ill repent and wish for all that that i had not killed them and twenty of these puny lies ill tell that men shall swear i have discontinued school above a twelvemonth i have within my mind a thousand raw tricks of these bragging jacks which i will practise fie what a questions that if thou wert near a lewd interpreter but come ill tell thee all my whole device when i am in my coach which stays for us at the park gate and therefore haste away for we must measure twenty miles today i did my lord i am informed thoroughly of the cause which is the merchant here and which the jew is your name shylock of a strange nature is the suit you follow yet in such rule that the venetian law cannot impugn you as you do proceed you stand within his danger do you not do you confess the bond then must the jew be merciful the quality of mercy is not straind it droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath it is twice blest it blesseth him that gives and him that takes tis mightiest in the mightiest it becomes the throned monarch better than his crown his sceptre shows the force of temporal power the attribute to awe and majesty wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings but mercy is above this sceptred sway it is enthroned in the hearts of kings it is an attribute to god himself and earthly power doth then show likest gods when mercy seasons justice therefore jew though justice be thy plea consider this that in the course of justice none of us should see salvation we do pray for mercy and that same prayer doth teach us all to render the deeds of mercy i have spoke thus much to mitigate the justice of thy plea which if thou follow this strict court of venice must needs give sentence gainst the merchant there is he not able to discharge the money it must not be there is no power in venice can alter a decree established twill be recorded for a precedent and many an error by the same example will rush into the state it cannot be i pray you let me look upon the bond shylock theres thrice thy money offerd thee why this bond is forfeit and lawfully by this the jew may claim a pound of flesh to be by him cut off nearest the merchants heart be merciful take thrice thy money bid me tear the bond why then thus it is you must prepare your bosom for his knife for the intent and purpose of the law hath full relation to the penalty which here appeareth due upon the bond therefore lay bare your bosom it is so are there balance here to weigh the flesh have by some surgeon shylock on your charge to stop his wounds lest he do bleed to death it is not so expressd but what of that twere good you do so much for charity you merchant have you any thing to say your wife would give you little thanks for that if she were by to hear you make the offer a pound of that same merchants flesh is thine the court awards it and the law doth give it and you must cut this flesh from off his breast the law allows it and the court awards it tarry a little there is something else this bond doth give thee here no jot of blood the words expressly are a pound of flesh take then thy bond take thou thy pound of flesh but in the cutting it if thou dost shed one drop of christian blood thy lands and goods are by the laws of venice confiscate unto the state of venice thyself shalt see the act for as thou urgest justice be assured thou shalt have justice more than thou desirest soft the jew shall have all justice soft no haste he shall have nothing but the penalty therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh shed thou no blood nor cut thou less nor more but just a pound of flesh if thou cutst more or less than a just pound be it but so much as makes it light or heavy in the substance or the division of the twentieth part of one poor scruple nay if the scale do turn but in the estimation of a hair thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate why doth the jew pause take thy forfeiture he hath refused it in the open court he shall have merely justice and his bond thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture to be so taken at thy peril jew tarry jew the law hath yet another hold on you it is enacted in the laws of venice if it be proved against an alien that by direct or indirect attempts he seek the life of any citizen the party gainst the which he doth contrive shall seize one half his goods the other half comes to the privy coffer of the state and the offenders life lies in the mercy of the duke only gainst all other voice in which predicament i say thou standst for it appears by manifest proceeding that indirectly and directly too thou hast contrived against the very life of the defendant and thou hast incurrd the danger formerly by me rehearsed down therefore and beg mercy of the duke ay for the state not for antonio what mercy can you render him antonio art thou contented jew what dost thou say clerk draw a deed of gift i humbly do desire your grace of pardon i must away this night toward padua and it is meet i presently set forth he is well paid that is well satisfied and i delivering you am satisfied and therein do account myself well paid my mind was never yet more mercenary i pray you know me when we meet again i wish you well and so i take my leave you press me far and therefore i will yield   give me your gloves ill wear them for your sake   and for your love ill take this ring from you do not draw back your hand ill take no more and you in love shall not deny me this i will have nothing else but only this and now methinks i have a mind to it i see sir you are liberal in offers you taught me first to beg and now methinks you teach me how a beggar should be answerd that scuse serves many men to save their gifts an if your wife be not a madwoman and know how well i have deserved the ring she would not hold out enemy for ever for giving it to me well peace be with you inquire the jews house out give him this deed and let him sign it well away tonight and be a day before our husbands home this deed will be well welcome to lorenzo that cannot be his ring i do accept most thankfully and so i pray you tell him furthermore i pray you show my youth old shylocks house aside to nerissa  thou mayst i warrant we shall have old swearing that they did give the rings away to men but well outface them and outswear them too   away make haste thou knowist where i will tarry that light we see is burning in my hall how far that little candle throws his beams so shines a good deed in a naughty world so doth the greater glory dim the less a substitute shines brightly as a king unto the king be by and then his state empties itself as doth an inland brook into the main of waters music hark nothing is good i see without respect methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day the crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark when neither is attended and i think the nightingale if she should sing by day when every goose is cackling would be thought no better a musician than the wren how many things by season seasond are to their right praise and true perfection peace ho the moon sleeps with endymion and would not be awaked he knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo by the bad voice we have been praying for our husbands healths which speed we hope the better for our words are they returnd go in nerissa give order to my servants that they take no note at all of our being absent hence nor you lorenzo jessica nor you this night methinks is but the daylight sick it looks a little paler tis a day such as the day is when the sun is hid let me give light but let me not be light for a light wife doth make a heavy husband and never be bassanio so for me but god sort all you are welcome home my lord you should in all sense be much bound to him for as i hear he was much bound for you sir you are very welcome to our house it must appear in other ways than words therefore i scant this breathing courtesy a quarrel ho already whats the matter you were to blame i must be plain with you to part so slightly with your wifes first gift a thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger and so riveted with faith unto your flesh i gave my love a ring and made him swear never to part with it and here he stands i dare be sworn for him he would not leave it nor pluck it from his finger for the wealth that the world masters now in faith gratiano you give your wife too unkind a cause of grief an twere to me i should be mad at it what ring gave you my lord not that i hope which you received of me even so void is your false heart of truth by heaven i will neer come in your bed until i see the ring if you had known the virtue of the ring or half her worthiness that gave the ring or your own honour to contain the ring you would not then have parted with the ring what man is there so much unreasonable if you had pleased to have defended it with any terms of zeal wanted the modesty to urge the thing held as a ceremony nerissa teaches me what to believe ill die fort but some woman had the ring let not that doctor eer come near my house since he hath got the jewel that i loved and that which you did swear to keep for me i will become as liberal as you ill not deny him any thing i have no not my body nor my husbands bed know him i shall i am well sure of it lie not a night from home watch me like argus if you do not if i be left alone now by mine honour which is yet mine own ill have that doctor for my bedfellow sir grieve not you you are welcome notwithstanding mark you but that in both my eyes he doubly sees himself in each eye one swear by your double self and theres an oath of credit then you shall be his surety give him this and bid him keep it better than the other i had it of him pardon me bassanio for by this ring the doctor lay with me speak not so grossly you are all amazed here is a letter read

abundance as your good fortunes are and yet for aught i see they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve with nothing it is no mean happiness therefore to be seated in the mean superfluity comes sooner by white hairs but competency lives longer they would be better if well followed your father was ever virtuous and holy men at their death have good inspirations therefore the lottery that he hath devised in these three chests of gold silver and lead whereof who chooses his meaning chooses you will no doubt never be chosen by any rightly but one who shall rightly love but what warmth is there in your affection towards any of these princely suitors that are already come first there is the neapolitan prince then there is the county palatine how say you by the french lord monsieur le bon what say you then to falconbridge the young baron of england what think you of the scottish lord his neighbour how like you the young german the duke of saxonys nephew if he should offer to choose and choose the right casket you should refuse to perform your fathers will if you should refuse to accept him you need not fear lady the having any of these lords they have acquainted me with their determinations which is indeed to return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit unless you may be won by some other sort than your fathers imposition depending on the caskets do you not remember lady in your fathers time a venetian a scholar and a soldier that came hither in company of the marquis of montferrat true madam he of all the men that ever my foolish eyes looked

three thousand ducats for three months and antonio bound antonio is a good man oh no no no no my meaning in saying he is a good man is to have you understand me that he is sufficient yet his means are in supposition he hath an argosy bound to tripolis another to the indies i understand moreover upon the rialto he hath a third at mexico a fourth for england and other ventures he hath squandered abroad but ships are but boards sailors but men there be landrats and waterrats waterthieves and landthieves i mean pirates and then there is the peril of waters winds and rocks the man is

the end of autumn turned to the rams and when the work of generation was between these woolly breeders in the act the skilful shepherd peeld me certain wands and in the doing of the deed of kind he stuck them up before the fulsome ewes who then conceiving did in eaning time fall particolourd lambs and those were jacobs this was a way to thrive and he was blest and thrift is blessing if men steal

addressd me fortune now to my hearts hope gold silver and base lead who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath you shall look fairer ere i give or hazard what says the golden chest ha let me see who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire what many men desire that many may be meant by the fool multitude that choose by show not learning more than the fond eye doth teach which pries not to the interior but like the martlet builds in the weather on the outward wall even in the force and road of casualty i will not choose what many men desire because i will not jump with common spirits and rank me with the barbarous multitudes why then to thee thou silver treasurehouse tell me once more what title thou dost bear who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves and well said too for who shall go about to cozen fortune and be honourable without the stamp of merit let none presume to wear an undeserved dignity o that estates degrees and offices were not derived corruptly and that clear honour were purchased by the merit of the wearer how many then should cover that stand bare how many be commanded that command how much low peasantry would then be gleand from the true seed of honour and how much honour pickd from the chaff and ruin of the times to be newvarnishd well but to my choice who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves i will assume desert give me a key for this and instantly unlock my fortunes here whats here the portrait of a blinking idiot presenting me a schedule i will read it how much unlike art thou to portia how much unlike my hopes and my

patiently to bear my wrothi often came where i did hear of her but cannot find her yes other men have ill luck too antonio as i heard in genoa hath an argosy cast away coming from tripolis i spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck your daughter spent in genoa as i heard in one night fourscore ducats there came divers of antonios creditors in my company to venice that swear he cannot choose but break one of them showed me a ring that he had of your daughter for a monkey but antonio is certainly undoneding dong belli did my lord and i have reason for it signior antonio commends him to you not sick my lord unless it be in mind nor well unless in mind his letter there will show you his estate i would you had won the fleece that he hath lost not one my lord besides it should appear that if he had the present money to discharge the jew he would not take it never did i know a creature that did bear the shape of man so keen and greedy to confound a man he plies the duke at morning and at night and doth impeach the freedom of the state if they deny him justice twenty merchants the duke himself and the magnificoes of greatest port have all persuaded with him but none can drive him from the envious plea of forfeiture of justice and his bond he is ready at the door he comes my lord my lord here stays without a messenger with letters from the doctor new come from paduamadam i go with all convenient speedwhat is antonio here i am sorry for thee thou art come to answer a stony adversary an inhuman wretch uncapable of pity void and empty from any dram of mercy go one and call the jew into the court make room and let him stand before our face shylock the world thinks and i think so too that thou but leadst this fashion of thy malice to the last hour of act and then tis thought thoult show thy mercy and remorse more strange than is thy strange apparent cruelty and where thou now exactst the penalty which is a pound of this poor merchants flesh thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture but touchd with human gentleness and love forgive a moiety of the principal glancing an eye of pity on his losses that have of late so huddled on his back enow to press a royal merchant down and pluck commiseration of his state from brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint from stubborn turks and tartars never traind to offices of tender courtesy we all expect a gentle answer jew how shalt thou hope for mercy rendering none upon my power i may dismiss this court unless bellario a learned doctor whom i have sent for to determine this come here today bring us the letter call the messenger came you from padua from bellario this letter from bellario doth commend a young and learned doctor to our court where is he with all my heart some three or four of you

you from old bellario you are welcome take your place are you acquainted with the difference that holds this present question in the court antonio and old shylock both stand forth that thou shalt see the difference of our spirits i pardon thee thy life before thou ask it for half thy wealth it is antonios the other half comes to the general state which humbleness may drive unto a fine he shall do this or else i do recant the pardon that i late pronounced here get thee gone but do it sir i entreat you home with me to dinner i am sorry that your leisure serves you not antonio gratify this gentleman for in my mind you are much bound to himreads your grace shall understand that at the receipt of your letter i am very sick but in the instant that your messenger came in loving visitation was with me a young doctor of rome his name is balthasar i acquainted him with the cause in controversy between the jew and antonio the merchant we turned oer many books together he is furnished with my opinion which bettered with his own learning the greatness whereof i cannot enough commend comes with him at my importunity to fill up your graces request in my stead i beseech you let his lack of years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation for i never knew so young a body with so old a head i leave him to your gracious acceptance whose trial shall better publish his commendationa friend stephano is my name and i bring word my mistress will before the break of day be here at belmont she doth stray about by holy crosses where she kneels and prays for happy wedlock hours none but a holy hermit and her maid i pray you is my master yet returnd
