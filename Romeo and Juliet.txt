retorts it romeo he cries aloud hold friends friends part and swifter than his tongue his agile arm beats down their fatal points and twixt them rushes underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio and then tybalt fled but by and by comes back to romeo who had but newly entertaind revenge and to t they go like lightning for ere i could draw to part them was

hath catchd it from my sight the people in the street cry romeo some juliet and some paris and all run with open outcry toward our monument o me this sight of death is as a bell that warns my old age to a sepulchrethou villain capulethold me not let me go who set this ancient quarrel new abroach speak nephew were you by when it began many a morning hath he there been seen with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs but all so soon as the allcheering sun should in the furthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from auroras bed away from the light steals home my heavy son and private in his chamber pens himself shuts up his windows locks far daylight out and makes himself an artificial night black and portentous must this humour prove unless good counsel may the cause remove i neither know it nor can learn of him both by myself and many other friends but he his own affections counsellor is to himselfi will not say how true but to himself so secret and so close so far from sounding and discovery as is the bud bit with an envious worm ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air or dedicate his beauty to the sun could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow we would as willingly give cure as know i would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift come madam lets away not romeo prince he was mercutios friend his fault concludes but what the law should end the life of tybalt alas my liege my wife is dead tonight grief of my sons exile hath stoppd her breath what further woe conspires against mine age o thou untaught what manners is in this to press before thy father to a grave but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold that while verona by that name is known there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful julietthou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe o where is romeo saw you him today right glad i am he was not at this frayrebellious subjects enemies to peace profaners of this neighbourstained steel will they not hear what ho you men you beasts that quench the fire of your pernicious rage with purple fountains issuing from your veins on pain of torture from those bloody hands throw your mistemperd weapons to the ground and hear the sentence of your moved prince three civil brawls bred of an airy word by thee old capulet and montague have thrice disturbd the quiet of our streets and made veronas ancient citizens cast by their grave beseeming ornaments to wield old partisans in hands as old cankerd with peace to part your cankerd hate if ever you disturb our streets again your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace for this time all the rest depart away you capulet shall go along with me and montague come you this afternoon to know our further pleasure in this case to old freetown our common judgmentplace once more on pain of death all men depart where are the vile beginners of this fray benvolio who began this bloody fray romeo slew him he slew mercutio who now the price of his dear blood doth owe and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence i have an interest in your hates proceeding my blood for your rude brawls doth lie ableeding but ill amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine i will be deaf to pleading and excuses nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses therefore use none let romeo hence in haste else when hes found that hour is his last bear hence this body and attend our will mercy but murders pardoning those that kill what misadventure is so early up that calls our person from our mornings rest what fear is this which startles in our ears search seek and know how this foul murder comes come montague for thou art early up to see thy son and heir more early down look and thou shalt see seal up the mouth of outrage for a while till we can clear these ambiguities and know their spring their head their true descent and then will i be general of your woes and lead you even to death meantime forbear and let mischance be slave to patience bring forth the parties of suspicion then say at once what thou dost know in this we still have known thee for a holy man wheres romeos man what can he say in this give me the letter i will look on it where is the countys page that raised the watch sirrah what made your master in this place this letter doth make good the friars words their course of love the tidings of her death and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor pothecary and therewithal came to this vault to die and lie with juliet where be these enemies capulet montague see what a scourge is laid upon your hate that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love and i for winking at your discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punishd a glooming peace this morning with it brings the sun for sorrow will not show his head go hence to have more talk of these sad things some shall be pardond and some punished for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeois the day so young ay me sad hours seem long was that my father that went hence so fast not having that which having makes them short out out of her favour where i am in love alas that love whose view is muffled still should without eyes see pathways to his will where shall we dine o me what fray was here yet tell me not for i have heard it all heres much to do with hate but more with love why then o brawling love o loving hate o any thing of nothing first create o heavy lightness serious vanity misshapen chaos of wellseeming forms feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health stillwaking sleep that is not what it is this love feel i that feel no love in this dost thou not laugh good heart at what why such is loves transgression griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast which thou wilt propagate to have it prest with more of thine this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs being purged a fire sparkling in lovers eyes being vexd a sea nourishd with lovers tears what is it else a madness most discreet a choking gall and a preserving sweet farewell my coz tut i have lost myself i am not here this is not romeo hes some other where what shall i groan and tell thee bid a sick man in sadness make his will ah word ill urged to one that is so ill in sadness cousin i do love a woman a right good markman and shes fair i love well in that hit you miss shell not be hit with cupids arrow she hath dians wit and in strong proof of chastity well armd from loves weak childish bow she lives unharmd she will not stay the siege of loving terms nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes nor ope her lap to saintseducing gold o she is rich in beauty only poor that when she dies with beauty dies her store she hath and in that sparing makes huge waste for beauty starved with her severity cuts beauty off from all posterity she is too fair too wise wisely too fair to merit bliss by making me despair she hath forsworn to love and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now o teach me how i should forget to think tis the way to call hers exquisite in question more these happy masks that kiss fair ladies brows being black put us in mind they hide the fair he that is strucken blind cannot forget the precious treasure of his eyesight lost show me a mistress that is passing fair what doth her beauty serve but as a note where i may read who passd that passing fair farewell thou canst not teach me to forget your plaintainleaf is excellent for that for your broken shin not mad but bound more than a madman is shut up in prison kept without my food whippd and tormented andgodden good fellow ay mine own fortune in my misery ay if i know the letters and the language stay fellow i can read   signior martino and his wife and daughters county anselme and his beauteous sisters the lady widow of vitravio signior placentio and his lovely nieces mercutio and his brother valentine mine uncle capulet his wife and daughters my fair niece rosaline livia signior valentio and his cousin tybalt lucio and the lively helena a fair assembly whither should they come whither whose house indeed i should have askd you that before when the devout religion of mine eye maintains such falsehood then turn tears to fires and these who often drownd could never die transparent heretics be burnt for liars one fairer than my love the allseeing sun neer saw her match since first the world begun ill go along no such sight to be shown but to rejoice in splendor of mine own what shall this speech be spoke for our excuse or shall we on without a apology give me a torch i am not for this ambling being but heavy i will bear the light not i believe me you have dancing shoes with nimble soles i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i cannot move i am too sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers and so bound i cannot bound a pitch above dull woe under loves heavy burden do i sink is love a tender thing it is too rough too rude too boisterous and it pricks like thorn a torch for me let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels for i am proverbd with a grandsire phrase ill be a candleholder and look on the game was neer so fair and i am done nay thats not so and we mean well in going to this mask but tis no wit to go i dreamd a dream tonight well what was yours in bed asleep while they do dream things true peace peace mercutio peace thou talkst of nothing i fear too early for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this nights revels and expire the term of a despised life closed in my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death but he that hath the steerage of my course direct my sail on lusty gentlemen to a servingman  what lady is that which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight o she doth teach the torches to burn bright it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an ethiopes ear beauty too rich for use for earth too dear so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows as yonder lady oer her fellows shows the measure done ill watch her place of stand and touching hers make blessed my rude hand did my heart love till now forswear it sight for i neer saw true beauty till this night to juliet  if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine the gentle fine is this my lips two blushing pilgrims ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss have not saints lips and holy palmers too o then dear saint let lips do what hands do they pray grant thou lest faith turn to despair then move not while my prayers effect i take thus from my lips by yours my sin is purged sin from thy lips o trespass sweetly urged give me my sin again what is her mother is she a capulet o dear account my life is my foes debt ay so i fear the more is my unrest can i go forward when my heart is here turn back dull earth and find thy centre out he jests at scars that never felt a wound   but soft what light through yonder window breaks it is the east and juliet is the sun arise fair sun and kill the envious moon who is already sick and pale with grief that thou her maid art far more fair than she be not her maid since she is envious her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it cast it off it is my lady o it is my love o that she knew she were she speaks yet she says nothing what of that her eye discourses i will answer it i am too bold tis not to me she speaks two of the fairest stars in all the heaven having some business do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return what if her eyes were there they in her head the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars as daylight doth a lamp her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night see how she leans her cheek upon her hand o that i were a glove upon that hand that i might touch that cheek she speaks o speak again bright angel for thou art as glorious to this night being oer my

hereabouts he dwellswhich late i noted in tatterd weeds with overwhelming brows culling of simples meagre were his looks sharp misery had worn him to the bones and in his needy shop a tortoise hung an alligator stuffd and other skins of illshaped fishes and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes green earthen pots bladders and musty seeds remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses were thinly scatterd to make up a show noting this penury to myself i said an if a man did need a poison now whose sale is present death in mantua here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him o this same thought did but forerun my need and this same needy man must sell it me as i remember this should be the house being holiday the beggars shop is shut what ho apothecary come hither man i see that thou art poor hold there is forty ducats let me have a dram of poison such soonspeeding gear as will disperse itself through all the veins that the lifeweary taker may fall dead and that the trunk may

oppression starveth in thine eyes contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back the world is not thy friend nor the worlds law the world affords no law to make thee rich then be not poor but break it and

hence be gone but if thou jealous dost return to pry in what i further shall intend to do by heaven i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs the time and my intents are savagewild more fierce and more inexorable far than empty tigers or the roaring sea so shalt thou show me friendship take thou that live and be prosperous and farewell good fellow thou detestable maw thou womb of death gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth thus i enforce thy rotten jaws to open and in despite ill cram thee with more food i must indeed and therefore came i

tybalts tybalts death was woe enough if it had ended there or if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be rankd with other griefs why followd not when she said tybalts dead thy father or thy mother nay or both which modern lamentations might have moved but with a rearward following tybalts death romeo is banished to speak that word is father mother tybalt romeo juliet all slain all dead

send him back who ist that calls is it my lady mother is she not down so late or up so early what unaccustomd cause procures her hither madam i am not well yet let me weep for such a feeling loss feeling so the loss cannot choose but ever weep the friend what villain madam aside  villain and he be many miles asunder god pardon him i do with all my heart and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart ay madam from the reach of these my hands would none but i might venge my cousins death indeed i never shall be satisfied with romeo till i behold himdead is my poor heart for a kinsman vexd madam if you could find out but a man to bear a poison i would temper it that romeo should upon receipt thereof soon sleep in quiet o how my heart abhors to hear him named and cannot come to him to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body that slaughterd him and joy comes well in such a needy time what are they i beseech your ladyship madam in happy time what day is that now by saint peters church and peter too he shall not make me there a joyful bride i wonder at this haste that i must wed ere he that should be husband comes to woo i pray you tell my lord and father madam i will not marry yet and when i do i swear it shall be romeo whom you know i hate rather than paris these are news indeed not proud you have but thankful that you have proud can i never be of what i hate but thankful even for hate that is meant love good father i beseech you on my knees hear me with patience but to speak a word is there no pity sitting in the clouds that sees into the bottom of my grief o sweet my mother cast me not away delay this marriage for a month a week or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies o godo nurse how shall this be prevented my husband is on earth my faith in heaven how shall that faith return again to earth unless that husband send it me from heaven by leaving earth comfort me counsel me alack alack that heaven should practise stratagems upon so soft a subject as myself what sayst thou hast thou not a word of joy some comfort nurse speakest thou from thy heart amen well thou hast comforted me marvellous much go in and tell my lady i am gone having displeased my father to laurence cell to make confession and to be absolved ancient damnation o most wicked fiend is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue which she hath praised him with above compare so many thousand times go counsellor thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain ill to the friar to know his remedy if all else fail myself have power to die that may be sir when i may be a wife what must be shall be to answer that i should confess to you i will confess to you that i love him if i do so it will be of more price being spoke behind your back than to your face the tears have got small victory by that for it was bad enough before their spite that is no slander sir which is a truth and what i spake i spake it to my face it may be so for it is not mine own are you at leisure holy father now or shall i come to you at evening mass o shut the door and when thou hast done so come weep with me past hope past cure past help tell me not friar that thou hearst of this unless thou tell me how i may prevent it if in thy wisdom thou canst give no help do thou but call my resolution wise and with this knife ill help it presently god joind my heart and romeos thou our hands and ere this hand by thee to romeo seald shall be the label to another deed or my true heart with treacherous revolt turn to another this shall slay them both therefore out of thy longexperienced time give me some present counsel or behold twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the umpire arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honour bring be not so long to speak i long to die if what thou speakst speak not of remedy o bid me leap rather than marry paris from off the battlements of yonder tower or walk in thievish ways or bid me lurk where serpents are chain me with roaring bears or shut me nightly in a charnelhouse oercoverd quite with dead mens rattling bones with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls or bid me go into a newmade grave and hide me with a dead man in his shroud things that to hear them told have made me tremble and i will do it without fear or doubt to live an unstaind wife to my sweet love give me give me o tell not me of fear love give me strength and strength shall help afford farewell dear father where i have learnd me to repent the sin of disobedient opposition to you and your behests and am enjoind by holy laurence to fall prostrate here and beg your pardon pardon i beseech you henceforward i am ever ruled by you i met the youthful lord at laurence cell and gave him what becomed love i might not step oer the bounds of modesty nurse will you go with me into my closet to help me sort such needful ornaments as you think fit to furnish me tomorrow ay those attires are best but gentle nurse i pray thee leave me to my self tonight for i have need of many orisons to move the heavens to smile upon my state which well thou knowst is cross and full of sin no madam we have culld such necessaries as are behoveful for our state tomorrow so please you let me now be left alone and let the nurse this night sit up with you for i am sure you have your hands full all in this so sudden business farewell god knows when we shall meet again i have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins that almost freezes up the heat of life ill call them back again to comfort me nurse what should she do here my dismal scene i needs must act alone come vial what if this mixture do not work at all shall i be married then tomorrow morning no no this shall forbid it lie thou there   what if it be a poison which the friar subtly hath ministerd to have me dead lest in this marriage he should be dishonourd because he married me before to romeo i fear it is and yet methinks it should not for he hath still been tried a holy man how if when i am laid into the tomb i wake before the time that romeo come to redeem me theres a fearful point shall i not then be stifled in the vault to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in and there die strangled ere my romeo comes or if i live is it not very like the horrible conceit of death and night together with the terror of the place as in a vault an ancient receptacle where for these many hundred years the bones of all my buried ancestors are packed where bloody tybalt yet but green in earth lies festering in his shroud where as they say at some hours in the night spirits resort alack alack is it not like that i so early waking what with loathsome smells and shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth that living mortals hearing them run mad o if i wake shall i not be distraught environed with all these hideous fears and madly play with my forefathers joints and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud and in this rage with some great kinsmans bone as with a club dash out my desperate brains o look methinks i see my cousins ghost seeking out romeo that did spit his body upon a rapiers point stay tybalt stay romeo i come this do i drink to thee o comfortable friar where is my lord i do remember well where i should be and there i am where is my romeo go get thee hence for i will not away   whats here a cup closed in my true loves hand poison i see hath been his timeless end o churl drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after i will kiss thy lips haply some poison yet doth hang on them to make die with a restorative   thy lips are warm yea noise then ill be brief o happy dagger   this is thy sheath   there rust and let me dienay gentle romeo we must have you dance you are a lover borrow cupids wings and soar with them above a common bound and to sink in it should you burden love too great oppression for a tender thing if love be rough with you be rough with love prick love for pricking and you beat love down give me a case to put my visage in a visor for a visor what care i what curious eye doth quote deformities here are the beetle brows shall blush for me tut duns the mouse the constables own word if thou art dun well draw thee from the mire of this sirreverence love wherein thou stickst up to the ears come we burn daylight ho i mean sir in delay we waste our lights in vain like lamps by day take our good meaning for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits why may one ask and so did i that dreamers often lie o then i see queen mab hath been with you she is the fairies midwife and she comes in shape no bigger than an agatestone on the forefinger of an alderman drawn with a team of little atomies athwart mens noses as they lie asleep her wagonspokes made of long spiders legs the cover of the wings of grasshoppers the traces of the smallest spiders web the collars of the moonshines watery beams her whip of crickets bone the lash of film her wagoner a small greycoated gnat not so big as a round little worm prickd from the lazy finger of a maid her chariot is an empty hazelnut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub time out o mind the fairies coachmakers and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers brains and then they dream of love oer courtiers knees that dream on courtsies straight oer lawyers fingers who straight dream on fees oer ladies  lips who straight on kisses dream which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops oer a courtiers nose and then dreams he of smelling out a suit and sometime comes she with a tithepigs tail tickling a parsons nose as a lies asleep then dreams he of another benefice sometime she driveth oer a soldiers neck and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats of breaches ambuscadoes spanish blades of healths fivefathom deep and then anon drums in his ear at which he starts and wakes and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs which once untangled much misfortune bodes this is the hag when maids lie on their backs that presses them and learns them first to bear making them women of good carriage this is she true i talk of dreams which are the children of an idle brain begot of nothing but vain fantasy which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north and being angerd puffs away from thence turning his face to the dewdropping south he is wise and on my lie hath stoln him home to bed nay ill conjure too romeo humours madman

fair and honest and in his mistres s name i conjure only but to raise up him if love be blind love cannot hit the mark now will he sit under a medlar tree and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit

desire doth in his deathbed lie and young affection gapes to be his heir that fair for which love groand for and would die with tender juliet matchd is now not fair now romeo is beloved and loves again alike betwitched by the charm of looks but to his foe supposed he must complain and she steal loves sweet bait from fearful hooks being held a foe he may not have access to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear and she as much in love her means much less to meet her newbeloved any where but passion lends them power time means to meet tempering extremities with extreme sweetthe greyeyed morn smiles on the frowning night chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels from forth days path and titans fiery wheels now ere the sun advance his burning eye the day to cheer and nights dank dew to dry i must upfill this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and preciousjuiced flowers the earth thats natures mother is her tomb what is her burying grave that is her womb and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find many for many virtues excellent none but for some and yet all different o mickle is the powerful grace that lies in herbs plants stones and their true qualities for nought so vile that on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give nor aught so good but straind from that fair use revolts from true birth stumbling on abuse virtue itself turns vice being misapplied and vice sometimes by action dignified within the infant rind of this small flower poison hath residence and medicine power for this being smelt with that part cheers each part being tasted slays all senses with the heart two such opposed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs grace and rude will and where the worser is predominant full soon the canker death eats up that plant benedicite what early tongue so sweet saluteth me young son it argues a distemperd head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed care keeps his watch in every old mans eye and where care lodges sleep will never lie but where unbruised youth with unstuffd brain doth couch his limbs there golden sleep doth reign therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art uproused by some distemperature or if not so then here i hit it right our romeo hath not been in bed tonight be plain good son and homely in thy drift riddling confession finds but riddling shrift these violent delights have violent ends and in their triumph die like fire and powder which as they kiss consume the sweetest honey is loathsome in his own deliciousness and in the taste confounds the appetite therefore love moderately long love doth so too swift arrives as tardy as too slow   here comes the lady o so light a foot will neer wear out the everlasting flint a lover may bestride the gossamer that idles in the wanton summer air and yet not fall so light is vanity romeo come forth come forth thou fearful man affliction is enamourd of thy parts and thou art wedded to calamity too familiar is my dear son with such sour company i bring thee tidings of the princes doom o deadly sin o rude unthankfulness thy fault our law calls death but the kind prince taking thy part hath rushd aside the law and turnd that black word death to banishment this is dear mercy and thou seest it not arise one knocks good romeo hide thyself hold thy desperate hand art thou a man thy form cries out thou art thy tears are womanish thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast unseemly woman in a seeming man or illbeseeming beast in seeming both thou hast amazed me by my holy order i thought thy disposition better temperd hast thou slain tybalt wilt thou slay thyself and stay thy lady too that lives in thee by doing damned hate upon thyself why railst thou on thy birth the heaven and earth since birth and heaven and earth all three do meet in thee at once which thou at once wouldst lose fie fie thou shamest thy shape thy love thy wit which like a usurer aboundst in all and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thy shape thy love thy wit thy noble shape is but a form of wax digressing from the valour of a man thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury killing that love which thou hast vowd to cherish thy wit that ornament to shape and love misshapen in the conduct of them both like powder in a skitless soldiers flask is set afire by thine own ignorance and thou dismemberd with thine own defence what rouse thee man thy juliet is alive for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead there art thou happy tybalt would kill thee but thou slewst tybalt there are thou happy too the law that threatend death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile there art thou happy a pack of blessings lights up upon thy back happiness courts thee in her best array but like a misbehaved and sullen wench thou poutst upon thy fortune and thy love take heed take heed for such die miserable go get thee to thy love as was decreed ascend her chamber hence and comfort her but look thou stay not till the watch be set for then thou canst not pass to mantua where thou shalt live till we can find a time to blaze your marriage reconcile your friends beg pardon of the prince and call thee back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than thou wentst forth in lamentation go before nurse commend me to thy lady and bid her hasten all the house to bed which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto romeo is coming thats a certain text hold then go home be merry give consent to marry paris wednesday is tomorrow tomorrow night look that thou lie alone let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber take thou this vial being then in bed and this distilled liquor drink thou off when presently through all thy veins shall run a cold and drowsy humour for no pulse shall keep his native progress but surcease no warmth no breath shall testify thou livest the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade to paly ashes thy eyes windows fall like death when he shuts up the day of life each part deprived of supple government shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death and in this borrowd likeness of shrunk death thou shalt continue two and forty hours and then awake as from a pleasant sleep now when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed there art thou dead then as the manner of our country is in thy best robes uncoverd on the bier thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all the kindred of the capulets lie in the mean time against thou shalt awake shall romeo by my letters know our drift and hither shall he come and he and i will watch thy waking and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua and this shall free thee from this present shame if no inconstant toy nor womanish fear abate thy valour in the acting it peace ho for shame confusions cure lives not in these confusions heaven and yourself had part in this fair maid now heaven hath all and all the better is it for the maid your part in her you could not keep from death but heaven keeps his part in eternal life the most you sought was her promotion for twas your heaven she should be advanced and weep ye now seeing she is advanced above the clouds as high as heaven itself o in this love you love your child so ill that you run mad seeing that she is well shes not well married that lives married long but shes best married that dies married young dry up your tears and stick your rosemary on this fair corse and as the custom is in all her best array bear her to church for though fond nature bids us an lament yet natures tears are reasons merriment this same should be the voice of friar john welcome from mantua what says romeo or if his mind be writ give me his letter saint francis be my speed how oft tonight have my old feet stumbled at graves whos there who is it go with me to the vault i hear some noise lady come from that nest of death contagion and unnatural sleep a

is here is rosaline whom thou didst love so dear so soon forsaken young mens love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes jesu maria what a deal of brine hath washd thy sallow cheeks for rosaline how much salt water thrown away in waste to season love that of it doth not taste the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears lo here upon thy

thing romeo   alack alack what blood is this which stains the stony entrance of this sepulchre what mean these masterless and gory swords to lie discolourd by this place of peace   romeo o pale who else what paris too and steepd in blood ah what an unkind hour is guilty of this lamentable chance the lady stirs i am the greatest able to do least yet most suspected as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murder and here i stand both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excused i will be brief for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale romeo there dead was husband to that juliet and she there dead that romeos faithful wife i married them and their stoln marriageday was tybalts doomsday whose untimely death banishd the newmade bridegroom from the city for whom and not for tybalt juliet pined you to remove that siege of grief from her betrothd and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me and with wild looks bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage or in my cell there would she kill herself then gave i her so tutord by my art a sleeping potion which so took effect as i intended for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo that he should hither come as this dire night to help to take her from her borrowd grave being the time the potions force should cease but he which bore my letter friar john was stayd by accident and yesternight returnd my letter back then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking came i to take her from her kindreds vault meaning to keep her closely at my cell till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came some minute ere the time of her awaking here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead she wakes and i entreated her come forth and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb and she too desperate would not go with me but as it seems did violence on herself all this i know and to the marriage her nurse is privy and if aught in this miscarried by my fault let my old life be sacrificed some hour before his time unto the rigour of severest lawanon i saw no man
