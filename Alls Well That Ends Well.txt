a herald of my tongue where the impression of mine eye infixing contempt his scornful perspective did lend me which warpd the line of every other favour scornd a fair colour or expressd it stolen extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object thence it came that she whom all men praised and whom myself since i have lost have loved was in mine eye the dust that did offend it hers it was not my gracious sovereign howeer it pleases you to take it so the ring was never hers you are deceived my lord she never saw it in florence was it from a casement thrown me wrappd in a paper which containd the name of her that threw it noble she was and thought i stood engaged but when i had subscribed to mine own fortune and informd her fully i could not answer in that course of honour as she had made the overture she ceased in heavy satisfaction and would never receive the ring again she never saw it if you shall prove this ring was ever hers you shall as easy prove that i husbanded her bed in florence where yet she never was my lord i neither can nor will deny but that i know them do they charge me further shes none of mine my lord my lord this is a fond and desperate creature whom sometime i have laughd with let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honour than for to think that i would sink it here shes impudent my lord and was a common gamester to the camp what of him hes quoted for a most perfidious slave with all the spots o the world taxd and deboshd whose nature sickens but to speak a truth am i or that or this for what hell utter that will speak any thing i think she has certain it is i liked her and boarded her i the wanton way of youth she knew her distance and did angle for me madding my eagerness with her restraint as all impediments in fancys course are motives of more fancy and in fine her infinite cunning with her modern grace subdued me to her rate she got the ring and i had that which any inferior might at marketprice have bought i have it not my lord i do confess the ring was hers both both o pardon if she my liege can make me know this clearly ill love her dearly ever ever dearlyyou shall find of the king a husband madam you sir a father he that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance he hath abandoned his physicians madam under whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time how called you the man you speak of madam he was excellent indeed madam the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have lived still if knowledge could be set up against mortality a fistula my lord i would it were not notorious was this gentlewoman the daughter of gerard de narbon your commendations madam get from her tears moderate lamentation is the right of the dead excessive grief the enemy to the living how understand we that he cannot want the best that shall attend his love farewell pretty lady you must hold the credit of your father kneeling

fears i am cressids uncle that dare leave two together fare you well they say miracles are past and we have our philosophical persons to make modern and familiar things supernatural and causeless

of all the learned and authentic fellows that gave him out incurable not to be helped uncertain life and sure death i may truly say it is a novelty to the world a showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor why your dolphin is not lustier fore me i speak in respect very hand of heaven in a most weak   and debile minister great power great transcendence which should indeed give us a further

have forgot him my imagination carries no favour int but bertrams i am undone there is no living none if bertram be away twere all one that i should love a bright particular star and think to wed it he is so above me in his bright radiance and collateral light must i be comforted not in his sphere the ambition in my love thus plagues itself the hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love twas pretty though plague to see him every hour to sit and draw his arched brows his hawking eye his curls in our hearts table heart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favour but now hes gone and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his reliques who comes here     one that goes with him i love him for his sake and yet i know him a notorious liar think him a great way fool solely a coward yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him that they take place when virtues steely bones look bleak i the cold wind withal full oft we see cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly and you monarch and no ay you have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a question man is enemy to virginity how may we barricado it against him but he assails and our virginity though valiant in the defence yet is weak unfold to us some warlike resistance bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up is there no military policy how virgins might blow up men i will stand for t a little though therefore i die a virgin how might one do sir to lose it to her own liking not my virginity yet           there shall your master have a thousand loves a mother and a mistress and a friend a phoenix captain and an enemy a guide a goddess and a sovereign a counsellor a traitress and a dear his humble ambition proud humility his jarring concord and his discord dulcet his faith his sweet disaster with a world of pretty fond adoptious christendoms that blinking cupid gossips now shall he i know not what he shall god send him well the courts a learning place and he is one that i wish well tis pity that wishing well had not a body int which might be felt that we the poorer born whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes might with effects of them follow our friends and show what we alone must think which never return us thanks monsieur parolles you were born under a charitable star i especially think under mars the wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under mars when he was retrograde i think rather you go so much backward when you fight so is running away when fear proposes the safety but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing and i like the wear well our remedies oft in ourselves do lie which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky gives us free scope only doth backward pull our slow designs when we ourselves are dull what power is it which mounts my love so high that makes me see and cannot feed mine eye the mightiest space in fortune nature brings to join like likes and kiss like native things impossible be strange attempts to those that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose what hath been cannot be who ever strove so show her merit that did miss her love the kings diseasemy project may

never know how that desert should be i know i love in vain strive against hope yet in this captious and intenible sieve i still pour in the waters of my love and lack not to lose still thus indianlike

your good father in his youth he had the wit which i can well observe today in our young lords but they may jest till their own scorn return to them unnoted ere they can hide their levity in honour so like a courtier contempt nor bitterness were in his pride or sharpness if they were his equal had awaked them and his honour clock to itself knew the true minute when exception bid him speak and at

bidding serve your majesty o tis brave wars no better if you please good my lord the reasons of our state i cannot yield but like a common and an outward man that the great figure of a council frames by selfunable motion therefore dare not say what i think of it since i have found myself in my incertain grounds to fail as often as i guessd believe it my lord in mine own direct knowledge without any malice but to speak of him as my kinsman hes a most notable coward an infinite and endless liar an hourly promisebreaker the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordships entertainment i with a troop of florentines will suddenly surprise him such i will have whom i am sure he knows not from the enemy we will bind and hoodwink him so that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries when we bring him to our own tents be but your lordship present at his examination if he do not for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath never trust my judgment in any thing no more than a fish loves water is not this a strange fellow my lord that so confidently seems to undertake this business which he knows is not to be done damns himself to do and dares better be damned than to dot none in the world but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies but we have almost embossed him you shall see his fall tonight for indeed he is not for your lordships respect i must go look my twigs he shall be caught ast please your lordship ill leave you he can come no other way but by this hedgecorner when you sally upon him speak what terrible language you will though you understand it not yourselves no matter for we must not seem to understand him unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter art not acquainted with him knows he not thy voice he must think us some band of strangers i the adversarys entertainment now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy not to know what we speak one to another so we seem to know is to know straight our purpose choughs language gabble enough and good enough as for you interpreter you must seem very politic but couch ho here he comes to beguile two hours in a sleep and then to return and swear the lies he forges this is the first truth that eer thine own tongue was guilty of we cannot afford you so twould not do hardly serve how deep oscorbidulchos volivorco go tell the count rousillon and my brother we have caught the woodcock and will keep him muffled till we do hear from them till then ill keep him dark and safely lockd i have delivered it an hour since there is something int that stings his nature for on the reading it he changed almost into another man especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him i will tell you a thing but you shall let it dwell darkly with you he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in florence of a most chaste renown and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour he hath given her his monumental ring and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition merely our own traitors and as in the common course of all treasons we still see them reveal themselves till they attain to their abhorred ends so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility in his proper stream oerflows himself i hear there is an overture of peace what will count rousillon do then will he travel higher or return again into france how is this justified i am heartily sorry that hell be glad of this and how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears the great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample they shall be no more than needful there if they were more than they can commend if the business be of any difficulty and this morning your departure hence it requires haste of your lordship bring him forth has sat i the stocks all night poor gallant knave i have told your lordship already the stocks carry him but to answer you as you would be understood he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk he hath confessed himself to morgan whom he supposes to be a friar from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i the stocks and what think you he hath confessed his confession is taken and it shall be read to his face if your lordship be int as i believe you are you must have the patience to hear it i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean nor believe he can have every thing in him by wearing his apparel neatly why does be ask him of me god bless you captain parolles captain what greeting will you to my lord lafeu i am for franceour hearts receive your warningswe understand it and thank heaven for you cargo cargo cargo villiando par corbo cargofair one i think not soso that from point to point now have you heard the fundamental reasons of this war whose great decision hath much blood let forth and more thirsts after therefore we marvel much our cousin france would in so just a business shut his bosom against our borrowing prayers be it his pleasure welcome

thitherward for thence we came and after some dispatch in hand at court thither we bend again such is his noble purpose and believe t the duke will lay upon him all the honour that good convenience claims we serve you madam in that and all your worthiest affairsay madam ay madam with the swiftest wing of speed a servant only and a gentleman which i have sometime known ay my good lady he indeed

more haste than is his use marry as i take it to rousillon whither i am going this ill do for you i shall my liege gracious sovereign whether i have been to blame or no i know not heres a petition from a florentine who hath for four or five removes come short to tender it herself i undertook it vanquishd thereto by the fair grace and speech of the poor suppliant who by this i know is here attending her business looks in her with an importing visage and she told me in a sweet verbal brief it did concern your highness with herselfnay come for if they do approach the city we shall lose all the sight it is reported that he has taken their greatest commander and that with his own hand he slew the dukes brother   we have lost our labour they are gone a contrary way hark you may know by their trumpets i have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion i hope so   look here comes a pilgrim i know she will lie at my house thither they send one another ill question her god save you pilgrim whither are you bound at the saint francis here beside the port ay marry ist   hark you they come this way if you will tarry holy pilgrim but till the troops come by i will conduct you where you shall be lodged the rather for i think i know your hostess as ample as myself if you shall please so pilgrim you came i think from france here you shall see a countryman of yours that has done worthy service i warrant good creature wheresoeer she is her heart weighs sadly this young maid might do her a shrewd turn if she pleased he does indeed and brokes with all that can in such a suit corrupt the tender honour of a maid but she is armd for him and keeps her guard in honestest defence so now they come     that is antonio the dukes eldest son that escalus marry hang you the troop is past come pilgrim i will bring you where you shall host of enjoind penitents theres four or five to great saint jaques bound already at my house though my estate be fallen i was well born nothing acquainted with these businesses and would not put my reputation now in any staining act i should believe you for you have showd me that which well approves youre great in fortune now i see the bottom of your purpose i have yielded instruct my daughter how she shall persever that time and place with this deceit so lawful may prove coherent every night he comes with musics of all sorts and songs composed to her unworthiness it nothing steads us to chide him from our eaves for he persists as if his life lay ont gentle madam you never had a servant to whose trust your business was more welcome lord how we lose our pains i am her mother sir whose age and honour both suffer under this complaint we bring and both shall cease without your remedythey say the french count has done most honourable service you shall not need to fear me the count rousillon know you such a one whatsomeer he is hes bravely taken here he stole from france as tis reported for the king had married him against his liking think you it is so there is a gentleman that serves the count reports but coarsely of her monsieur parolles alas poor lady tis a hard bondage to become the wife of a detesting lord he that with the plume tis a most gallant fellow i would he loved his wife if he were honester he were much goodlier ist not a handsome gentleman tis pity he is not honest yonds that same knave that leads him to these places were i his lady i would poison that vile rascal that jackanapes with scarfs why is he melancholy no my good lord diana she then was honest no my mother did but duty such my lord as you owe to your wife ay so you serve us till we serve you but when you have our roses you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves and mock us with our bareness tis not the many oaths that makes the truth but the plain single vow that is vowd true what is not holy that we swear not by but take the highst to witness then pray you tell me if i should swear by gods great attributes i loved you dearly would you believe my oaths when i did love you ill this has no holding to swear by him whom i protest to love that i will work against him therefore your oaths are words and poor conditions but unseald at least in my opinion i see that men make ropes in such a scarre that well forsake ourselves give me that ring will you not my lord mine honours such a ring my chastitys the jewel of our house bequeathed down from many ancestors which were the greatest obloquy i the world in me to lose thus your own proper wisdom brings in the champion honour on my part against your vain assault when midnight comes knock at my chamberwindow ill order take my mother shall not hear now will i charge you in the band of truth when you have conquerd my yet maiden bed remain there but an hour nor speak to me my reasons are most strong and you shall know them when back again this ring shall be deliverd and on your finger in the night ill put another ring that what in time proceeds may token to the future our past deeds adieu till then then fail not you have won a wife of me though there my hope be done for which live long to thank both heaven and me you may so in the end my mother told me just how he would woo as if she sat in s heart she says all men have the like oaths he had sworn to marry me when his wifes dead therefore ill lie with him when i am buried since frenchmen are so braid marry that will i live and die a maid only in this disguise i thinkt no sin to cozen him that would unjustly win let death and honesty go with your impositions i am yours upon your will to suffer i am my lord a wretched florentine derived from the ancient capilet my suit as i do understand you know and therefore know how far i may be pitied why do you look so strange upon your wife if you shall marry you give away this hand and that is mine you give away heavens vows and those are mine you give away myself which is known mine for i by vow am so embodied yours that she which marries you must marry me either both or none good my lord ask him upon his oath if he does think he had not my virginity he does me wrong my lord if i were so he might have bought me at a common price do not believe him o behold this ring whose high respect and rich validity did lack a parallel yet for all that he gave it to a commoner o the camp if i be one i did my lord but loath am to produce so bad an instrument his names parolles i must be patient you that have turnd off a first so noble wife may justly diet me i pray you yet since you lack virtue i will lose a husband send for your ring i will return it home and give me mine again sir much like the same upon your finger and this was it i gave him being abed i have spoke the truth ay my lord do you know he promised me marriage ay my good lord it was not given me nor i did not buy it it was not lent me neither i found it not i never gave it him it might be yours or hers for aught i know ill never tell you ill put in bail my liege by jove if ever i knew man twas you because hes guilty and he is not guilty he knows i am no maid and hell swear tot ill swear i am a maid and he knows not great king i am no strumpet by my life i am either maid or else this old mans wife good mother fetch my bail stay royal sir   the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for and he shall surety me but for this lord who hath abused me as he knows himself though yet he never harmd me here i quit him he knows himself my bed he hath defiled and at that time he got his wife with child dead though she be she feels her young one kick so theres my riddle one thats dead is quick and now behold the meaningcome lets return again and suffice ourselves with the report of it well diana take heed of this french earl the honour of a maid is her name and no legacy is so rich as honesty i know that knave hang him one parolles a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl beware of them diana their promises enticements oaths tokens and all these engines of lust are not the things they go under many a maid hath been seduced by them and the misery is example that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood cannot for all that dissuade succession but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them i hope i need not to advise you further but i hope your own grace will keep you where you are though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost the gods forbid else hes shrewdly vexed at something look he has spied us and your courtesy for a ringcarrierwell take
