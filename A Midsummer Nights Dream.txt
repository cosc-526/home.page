now fair hippolyta our nuptial hour draws on apace four happy days bring in another moon but o methinks how slow this old moon wanes she lingers my desires like to a stepdame or a dowager long withering out a young man revenue go philostrate stir up the athenian youth to merriments awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth turn melancholy forth to funerals the pale companion is not for our pomp   hippolyta i wood thee with my sword and won thy love doing thee injuries but i will wed thee in another key with pomp with triumph and with revelling thanks good egeus whats the news with thee what say you hermia be advised fair maid to you your father should be as a god one that composed your beauties yea and one to whom you are but as a form in wax by him imprinted and within his power to leave the figure or disfigure it demetrius is a worthy gentleman in himself he is but in this kind wanting your fathers voice the other must be held the worthier rather your eyes must with his judgment look either to die the death or to abjure for ever the society of men therefore fair hermia question your desires know of your youth examine well your blood whether if you yield not to your fathers choice you can endure the livery of a nun for aye to be in shady cloister mewd to live a barren sister all your life chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon thriceblessed they that master so their blood to undergo such maiden pilgrimage but earthlier happy is the rose distilld than that which withering on the virgin thorn grows lives and dies in single blessedness take time to pause and by the next new moon the sealingday betwixt my love and me for everlasting bond of fellowship upon that day either prepare to die for disobedience to your fathers will or else to wed demetrius as he would or on dianas altar to protest for aye austerity and single life i must confess that i have heard so much and with demetrius thought to have spoke thereof but being overfull of selfaffairs my mind did lose it but demetrius come and come egeus you shall go with me i have some private schooling for you both for you fair hermia look you arm yourself to fit your fancies to your fathers will or else the law of athens yields you up which by no means we may extenuate to death or to a vow of single life come my hippolyta what cheer my love demetrius and egeus go along i must employ you in some business against our nuptial and confer with you of something nearly that concerns yourselves go one of you find out the forester for now our observation is performd and since we have the vaward of the day my love shall hear the music of my hounds uncouple in the western valley let them go dispatch i say and find the forester   we will fair queen up to the mountains top and mark the musical confusion of hounds and echo in conjunction my hounds are bred out of the spartan kind so flewd so sanded and their heads are hung with ears that sweep away the morning dew crookkneed and dewlappd like thessalian bulls slow in pursuit but matchd in mouth like bells each under each a cry more tuneable was never hollad to nor cheerd with horn in crete in sparta nor in thessaly judge when you hear but soft what nymphs are these no doubt they rose up early to observe the rite of may and hearing our intent came here in grace our solemnity but speak egeus is not this the day that hermia should give answer of her choice go bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns   good morrow friends saint valentine is past begin these woodbirds but to couple now i pray you all stand up i know you two are rival enemies how comes this gentle concord in the world that hatred is so far from jealousy to sleep by hate and fear no enmity fair lovers you are fortunately met of this discourse we more will hear anon egeus i will overbear your will for in the temple by and by with us these couples shall eternally be knit and for the morning now is something worn our purposed hunting shall be set aside away with us to athens three and three well hold a feast in great solemnity come hippolyta more strange than true i never may believe these antique fables nor these fairy toys lovers and madmen have such seething brains such shaping fantasies that apprehend more than cool reason ever comprehends the lunatic the lover and the poet are of imagination all compact one sees more devils than vast hell can hold that is the madman the lover all as frantic sees helens beauty in a brow of egypt the poets eye in fine frenzy rolling doth glance from heaven to earth from earth to heaven and as imagination bodies forth the forms of things unknown the poets pen turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing a local habitation and a name such tricks hath strong imagination that if it would but apprehend some joy it comprehends some bringer of that joy or in the night imagining some fear how easy is a bush supposed a bear here come the lovers full of joy and mirth   joy gentle friends joy and fresh days of love accompany your hearts come now what masques what dances shall we have to wear away this long age of three hours between our aftersupper and bedtime where is our usual manager of mirth what revels are in hand is there no play to ease the anguish of a torturing hour call philostrate say what abridgement have you for this evening what masque what music how shall we beguile the lazy time if not with some delight reads  the battle with the centaurs to be sung by an athenian eunuch to the harp well none of that that have i told my love in glory of my kinsman hercules   the riot of the tipsy bacchanals tearing the thracian singer in their rage that is an old device and it was playd when i from thebes came last a conqueror   the thrice three muses mourning for the death of learning late deceased in beggary that is some satire keen and critical not sorting with a nuptial ceremony   a tedious brief scene of young pyramus and his love thisbe very tragical mirth merry and tragical tedious and brief that is hot ice and wondrous strange snow how shall we find the concord of this discord what are they that do play it and we will hear it i will hear that play for never anything can be amiss when simpleness and duty tender it go bring them in and take your places ladies why gentle sweet you shall see no such thing the kinder we to give them thanks for nothing our sport shall be to take what they mistake and what poor duty cannot do noble respect takes it in might not merit where i have come great clerks have purposed to greet me with premeditated welcomes where i have seen them shiver and look pale make periods in the midst of sentences throttle their practised accent in their fears and in conclusion dumbly have broke off not paying me a welcome trust me sweet out of this silence yet i pickd a welcome and in the modesty of fearful duty i read as much as from the rattling tongue of saucy and audacious eloquence love therefore and tonguetied simplicity in least speak most to my capacity let him approach this fellow doth not stand upon points his speech was like a tangled chain nothing impaired but all disordered who is next i wonder if the lion be to speak would you desire lime and hair to speak better pyramus draws near the wall silence the wall methinks being sensible should curse again now is the mural down between the two neighbours the best in this kind are but shadows and the worst are no worse if imagination amend them if we imagine no worse of them than they of themselves they may pass for excellent men here come two noble beasts in a man and a lion a very gentle beast of a good conscience true and a goose for his discretion his discretion i am sure cannot carry his valour for the goose carries not the fox it is well leave it to his discretion and let us listen to the moon he is no crescent and his horns are invisible within the circumference this is the greatest error of all the rest the man should be put into the lanthorn how is it else the man i the moon it appears by his small light of discretion that he is in the wane but yet in courtesy in all reason we must stay the time well run thisbe well moused lion this passion and the death of a dear friend would go near to make a man look sad with the help of a surgeon he might yet recover and prove an ass she will find him by starlight here she comes and her passion ends the play moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead no epilogue i pray you for your play needs no excuse never excuse for when the players are all dead there needs none to be blamed marry if he that writ it had played pyramus and hanged himself in thisbes garter it would have been a fine tragedy and so it is truly and very notably discharged but come your bergomask let your epilogue alone   the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve lovers to bed tis almost fairy time i fear we shall outsleep the coming morn as much as we this night have overwatchd this palpablegross play hath well beguiled the heavy gait of night sweet friends to bed a fortnight hold we this solemnity in nightly revels and new jollityfour days will quickly steep themselves in night four nights will quickly dream away the time and then the moon like to a silver bow newbent in heaven shall behold the night of our solemnities i was with hercules and cadmus once when in a wood of crete they bayd the bear with hounds of sparta never did i hear such gallant chiding for besides the groves the skies the fountains every region near seemd all one mutual cry i never heard so musical a discord such sweet thunder tis strange my theseus that these lovers speak of but all the story of the night told over and all their minds transfigured so together more witnesseth than fancys images and grows to something of great constancy but howsoever strange and admirable i love not to see wretchedness oer charged and duty in his service perishing he says they can do nothing in this kind indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child on a recorder a sound but not in government this is the silliest stuff that ever i heard it must be your imagination then and not theirs i am aweary of this moon would he would change well shone moon truly the moon shines with a good grace beshrew my heart but i pity the man how chance moonshine is gone before thisbe comes back and finds her lover methinks she should not use a long one for such a pyramus i hope she will be briefhappy be theseus our renowned duke full of vexation come i with complaint against my child my daughter hermia stand forth demetrius my noble lord this man hath my consent to marry her stand forth lysander and my gracious duke this man hath bewitchd the bosom of my child thou thou lysander thou hast given her rhymes and interchanged lovetokens with my child thou hast by moonlight at her window sung with feigning voice verses of feigning love and stolen the impression of her fantasy with bracelets of thy hair rings gawds conceits knacks trifles nosegays sweetmeats messengers of strong prevailment in unhardend youth with cunning hast thou filchd my daughters heart turnd her obedience which is due to me to stubborn harshness and my gracious duke be it so she will not here before your grace consent to marry with demetrius i beg the ancient privilege of athens as she is mine i may dispose of her which shall be either to this gentleman or to her death according to our law immediately provided in that case scornful lysander true he hath my love and what is mine my love shall render him and she is mine and all my right of her i do estate unto demetrius with duty and desire we follow you my lord this is my daughter here asleep and this lysander this demetrius is this helena old nedars helena i wonder of their being here together it is my lord enough enough my lord you have enough i beg the law the law upon his head they would have stolen away they would demetrius thereby to have defeated you and me you of your wife and me of my consent of my consent that she should be your wifeso is lysander i would my father lookd but with my eyes i do entreat your grace to pardon me i know not by what power i am made bold nor how it may concern my modesty in such a presence here to plead my thoughts but i beseech your grace that i may know the worst that may befall me in this case if i refuse to wed demetrius so will i grow so live so die my lord ere i will my virgin patent up unto his lordship whose unwished yoke my soul consents not to give sovereignty belike for want of rain which i could well beteem them from the tempest of my eyes o cross too high to be enthralld to low o spite too old to be engaged to young o hell to choose love by anothers eyes if then true lovers have been ever crossd it stands as an edict in destiny then let us teach our trial patience because it is a customary cross as due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs wishes and tears poor fancys followers my good lysander i swear to thee by cupids strongest bow by his best arrow with the golden head by the simplicity of venus doves by that which knitteth souls and prospers loves and by that fire which burnd the carthage queen when the false troyan under sail was seen by all the vows that ever men have broke in number more than ever women spoke in that same place thou hast appointed me tomorrow truly will i meet with thee god speed fair helena whither away i frown upon him yet he loves me still i give him curses yet he gives me love the more i hate the more he follows me his folly helena is no fault of mine take comfort he no more shall see my face lysander and myself will fly this place before the time i did lysander see seemd athens as a paradise to me o then what graces in my love do dwell that he hath turnd a heaven unto a hell and in the wood where often you and i upon faint primrosebeds were wont to lie emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet there my lysander and myself shall meet and thence from athens turn away our eyes to seek new friends and stranger companies farewell sweet playfellow pray thou for us and good luck grant thee thy demetrius keep word lysander we must starve our sight from lovers food till morrow deep midnight be it so lysander find you out a bed for i upon this bank will rest my head nay good lysander for my sake my dear lie further off yet do not lie so near lysander riddles very prettily now much beshrew my manners and my pride if hermia meant to say lysander lied but gentle friend for love and courtesy lie further off in human modesty such separation as may well be said becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid so far be distant and good night sweet friend thy love neer alter till thy sweet life end with half that wish the wishers eyes be pressd awaking  help me lysander help me do thy best to pluck this crawling serpent from my breast ay me for pity what a dream was here lysander look how i do quake with fear methought a serpent eat my heart away and you sat smiling at his cruel pray lysander what removed lysander lord what out of hearing gone no sound no word alack where are you speak an if you hear speak of all loves i swoon almost with fear no then i well perceive you all not nigh either death or you ill find immediately now i but chide but i should use thee worse for thou i fear hast given me cause to curse if thou hast slain lysander in his sleep being oer shoes in blood plunge in the deep and kill me too the sun was not so true unto the day as he to me would he have stolen away from sleeping hermia ill believe as soon this whole earth may be bored and that the moon may through the centre creep and so displease her brothers noontide with antipodes it cannot be but thou hast murderd him so should a murderer look so dead so grim whats this to my lysander where is he ah good demetrius wilt thou give him me out dog out cur thou drivest me past the bounds of maidens patience hast thou slain him then henceforth be never numberd among men o once tell true tell true even for my sake durst thou have lookd upon him being awake and hast thou killd him sleeping o brave touch could not a worm an adder do so much an adder did it for with doubler tongue than thine thou serpent never adder stung i pray thee tell me then that he is well a privilege never to see me more and from thy hated presence part i so see me no more whether he be dead or no dark night that from the eye his function takes the ear more quick of apprehension makes wherein it doth impair the seeing sense it pays the hearing double recompense thou art not by mine eye lysander found mine ear i thank it brought me to thy sound but why unkindly didst thou leave me so what love could press lysander from my side you speak not as you think it cannot be i am amazed at your passionate words i scorn you not it seems that you scorn me sweet do not scorn her so lysander whereto tends all this why are you grown so rude what change is this sweet love do you not jest what can you do me greater harm than hate hate me wherefore o me what news my love am not i hermia are not you lysander i am as fair now as i was erewhile since night you loved me yet since night you left me why then you left meo the gods forbid in earnest shall i say o me you juggler you cankerblossom you thief of love what have you come by night and stolen my loves heart from him puppet why so ay that way goes the game now i perceive that she hath made compare between our statures she hath urged her height and with her personage her tall personage her height forsooth she hath prevaild with him and are you grown so high in his esteem because i am so dwarfish and so low how low am i thou painted maypole speak how low am i i am not yet so low but that my nails can reach unto thine eyes lower hark again why get you gone who ist that hinders you what with lysander little again nothing but low and little why will you suffer her to flout me thus let me come to her you mistress all this coil is long of you nay go not back i am amazed and know not what to say never so weary never so in woe bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers i can no further crawl no further go my legs can keep no pace with my desires here will i rest me till the break of day heavens shield lysander if they mean a fray methinks i see these things with parted eye when every thing seems double yea and my fatherrelent sweet hermia and lysander yield thy crazed title to my certain right i love thee not therefore pursue me not where is lysander and fair hermia the one ill slay the other slayeth me thou toldst me they were stolen unto this wood and here am i and wode within this wood because i cannot meet my hermia hence get thee gone and follow me no more do i entice you do i speak you fair or rather do i not in plainest truth tell you i do not nor i cannot love you tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit for i am sick when i do look on thee you do impeach your modesty too much to leave the city and commit yourself into the hands of one that loves you not to trust the opportunity of night and the ill counsel of a desert place with the rich worth of your virginity ill run from thee and hide me in the brakes and leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts i will not stay thy questions let me go or if thou follow me do not believe but i shall do thee mischief in the wood i charge thee hence and do not haunt me thus stay on thy peril i alone will go o why rebuke you him that loves you so lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe so should the murderd look and so should i pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty yet you the murderer look as bright as clear as yonder venus in her glimmering sphere i had rather give his carcass to my hounds you spend your passion on a misprised mood i am not guilty of lysanders blood nor is he dead for aught that i can tell an if i could what should i get therefore there is no following her in this fierce vein here therefore for a while i will remain so sorrows heaviness doth heavier grow for debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe which now in some slight measure it will pay if for his tender here i make some stay awaking  o helena goddess nymph perfect divine to what my love shall i compare thine eyne crystal is muddy o how ripe in show thy lips those kissing cherries tempting grow that pure congealed white high taurus snow fannd with the eastern wind turns to a crow when thou holdst up thy hand o let me kiss this princess of pure white this seal of bliss lysander keep thy hermia i will none if eer i loved her all that love is gone my heart to her but as guestwise sojournd and now to helen is it home returnd there to remain disparage not the faith thou dost not know lest to thy peril thou aby it dear look where thy love comes yonder is thy dear if she cannot entreat i can compel i say i love thee more than he can do quick come no no hell   seem to break loose take on as you would follow but yet come not you are a tame man go i would i had your bond for i perceive a weak bond holds you ill not trust your word no sir she shall not though you take her part you are too officious in her behalf that scorns your services let her alone speak not of helena take not her part for if thou dost intend never so little show of love to her thou shalt aby it follow nay ill go with thee cheek by jole lysander speak again thou runaway thou coward art thou fled speak in some bush where dost thou hide thy head yea art thou there abide me if thou darest for well i wot thou runnst before me shifting every place and darest not stand nor look me in the face where art thou now nay then thou mockst me thou shalt buy this dear if ever i thy face by daylight see now go thy way faintness constraineth me to measure out my length on this cold bed by days approach look to be visited my lord fair helen told me of their stealth of this their purpose hither to this wood and i in fury hither followd them fair helena in fancy following me but my good lord i wot not by what power but by some power it ismy love to hermia melted as the snow seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaud which in my childhood i did dote upon and all the faith the virtue of my heart the object and the pleasure of mine eye is only helena to her my lord was i betrothd ere i saw hermia but like in sickness did i loathe this food but as in health come to my natural taste now i do wish it love it long for it and will for evermore be true to it these things seem small and undistinguishable are you sure that we are awake it seems to me that yet we sleep we dream do not you think the duke was here and bid us follow him why then we are awake lets follow him and by the way let us recount our dreams no wonder my lord one lion may when many asses do it is the wittiest partition that ever i heard discourse my lord no remedy my lord when walls are so wilful to hear without warning the very best at a beast my lord that eer i saw not so my lord for his valour cannot carry his discretion and the fox carries the goose he should have worn the horns on his head he dares not come there for the candle for you see it is already in snuff why all these should be in the lanthorn for all these are in the moon but silence here comes thisbe well roared lion and then came pyramus no die but an ace for him for he is but one a mote will turn the balance which pyramus which thisbe is the better he for a man god warrant us she for a woman god bless us and thus she means videlicet ay and wall tooyou have her fathers love demetrius let me have hermias do you marry him i am my lord as well derived as he as well possessd my love is more than his my fortunes every way as fairly rankd if not with vantage as demetrius and which is more than all these boasts can be i am beloved of beauteous hermia why should not i then prosecute my right demetrius ill avouch it to his head made love to nedars daughter helena and won her soul and she sweet lady dotes devoutly dotes dotes in idolatry upon this spotted and inconstant man how now my love why is your cheek so pale how chance the roses there do fade so fast ay me for aught that i could ever read could ever hear by tale or history the course of true love never did run smooth but either it was different in blood or else misgraffed in respect of years or else it stood upon the choice of friends or if there were a sympathy in choice war death or sickness did lay siege to it making it momentany as a sound swift as a shadow short as any dream brief as the lightning in the collied night that in a spleen unfolds both heaven and earth and ere a man hath power to say behold the jaws of darkness do devour it up so quick bright things come to confusion a good persuasion therefore hear me hermia i have a widow aunt a dowager of great revenue and she hath no child from athens is her house remote seven leagues and she respects me as her only son there gentle hermia may i marry thee and to that place the sharp athenian law cannot pursue us if thou lovest me then steal forth thy fathers house tomorrow night and in the wood a league without the town where i did meet thee once with helena to do observance to a morn of may there will i stay for thee keep promise love look here comes helena helen to you our minds we will unfold tomorrow night when phoebe doth behold her silver visage in the watery glass decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass a time that lovers flights doth still conceal through athens gates have we devised to steal i will my hermia   helena adieu as you on him demetrius dote on you fair love you faint with wandering in the wood and to speak troth i have forgot our way well rest us hermia if you think it good and tarry for the comfort of the day one turf shall serve as pillow for us both one heart one bed two bosoms and one troth o take the sense sweet of my innocence love takes the meaning in loves conference i mean that my heart unto yours is knit so that but one heart we can make of it two bosoms interchained with an oath so then two bosoms and a single troth then by your side no bedroom me deny for lying so hermia i do not lie amen amen to that fair prayer say i and then end life when i end loyalty here is my bed sleep give thee all his rest awaking  and run through fire i will for thy sweet sake transparent helena nature shows art that through thy bosom makes me see thy heart where is demetrius o how fit a word is that vile name to perish on my sword content with hermia no i do repent the tedious minutes i with her have spent not hermia but helena i love who will not change a raven for a dove the will of man is by his reason swayd and reason says you are the worthier maid things growing are not ripe until their season so i being young till now ripe not to reason and touching now the point of human skill reason becomes the marshal to my will and leads me to your eyes where i oerlook loves stories written in loves richest book she sees not hermia hermia sleep thou there and never mayst thou come lysander near for as a surfeit of the sweetest things the deepest loathing to the stomach brings or as tie heresies that men do leave are hated most of those they did deceive so thou my surfeit and my heresy of all be hated but the most of me and all my powers address your love and might to honour helen and to be her knight why should you think that i should woo in scorn scorn and derision never come in tears look when i vow i weep and vows so born in their nativity all truth appears how can these things in me seem scorn to you bearing the badge of faith to prove them true i had no judgment when to her i swore demetrius loves her and he loves not you you are unkind demetrius be not so for you love hermia this you know i know and here with all good will with all my heart in hermias love i yield you up my part and yours of helena to me bequeath whom i do love and will do till my death helen it is not so why should he stay whom love doth press to go lysanders love that would not let him bide fair helena who more engilds the night than all you fiery oes and eyes of light why seekst thou me could not this make thee know the hate i bear thee made me leave thee so stay gentle helena hear my excuse my love my life my soul fair helena thou canst compel no more than she entreat thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers helen i love thee by my life i do i swear by that which i will lose for thee to prove him false that says i love thee not if thou say so withdraw and prove it too away you ethiope hang off thou cat thou burr vile thing let loose or i will shake thee from me like a serpent thy love out tawny tartar out out loathed medicine hated potion hence demetrius i will keep my word with thee what should i hurt her strike her kill her dead although i hate her ill not harm her so ay by my life and never did desire to see thee more therefore be out of hope of question of doubt be certain nothing truer tis no jest that i do hate thee and love helena be not afraid she shall not harm thee helena get you gone you dwarf you minimus of hindering knotgrass made you bead you acorn now she holds me not now follow if thou darest to try whose right of thine or mine is most in helena where art thou proud demetrius speak thou now i will be with thee straight he goes before me and still dares me on when i come where he calls then he is gone the villain is much lighterheeld than i i followd fast but faster he did fly that fallen am i in dark uneven way and here will rest me   come thou gentle day for if but once thou show me thy grey light ill find demetrius and revenge this spite pardon my lord my lord i shall reply amazedly half sleep half waking but as yet i swear i cannot truly say how i came here but as i thinkfor truly would i speak and now do i bethink me so it is i came with hermia hither our intent was to be gone from athens where we might without the peril of the athenian law and he did bid us follow to the temple more than to us wait in your royal walks your board your bed he hath rid his prologue like a rough colt he knows not the stop a good moral my lord it is not enough to speak but to speak true this lion is a very fox for his valour proceed moon and so the lion vanished less than an ace man for he is dead he is nothing she hath spied him already with those sweet eyescall you me fair that fair again unsay demetrius loves your fair o happy fair your eyes are lodestars and your tongues sweet air more tuneable than lark to shepherds ear when wheat is green when hawthorn buds appear sickness is catching o were favour so yours would i catch fair hermia ere i go my ear should catch your voice my eye your eye my tongue should catch your tongues sweet melody were the world mine demetrius being bated the rest id give to be to you translated o teach me how you look and with what art you sway the motion of demetrius heart o that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill o that my prayers could such affection move the more i love the more he hateth me none but your beauty would that fault were mine how happy some oer other some can be through athens i am thought as fair as she but what of that demetrius thinks not so he will not know what all but he do know and as he errs doting on hermias eyes so i admiring of his qualities things base and vile folding no quantity love can transpose to form and dignity love looks not with the eyes but with the mind and therefore is wingd cupid painted blind nor hath loves mind of any judgement taste wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste and therefore is love said to be a child because in choice he is so oft beguiled as waggish boys in game themselves forswear so the boy love is perjured every where for ere demetrius lookd on hermias eyne he haild down oaths that he was only mine and when this hail some heat from hermia felt so he dissolved and showers of oaths did melt i will go tell him of fair hermias flight then to the wood will he tomorrow night pursue her and for this intelligence if i have thanks it is a dear expense but herein mean i to enrich my pain to have his sight thither and back again you draw me you hardhearted adamant but yet you draw not iron for my heart is true as steel leave you your power to draw and i shall have no power to follow you and even for that do i love you the more i am your spaniel and demetrius the more you beat me i will fawn on you use me but as your spaniel spurn me strike me neglect me lose me only give me leave unworthy as i am to follow you what worser place can i beg in your love and yet a place of high respect with me than to be used as you use your dog and i am sick when i look not on you your virtue is my privilege for that it is not night when i do see your face therefore i think i am not in the night nor doth this wood lack worlds of company for you in my respect are all the world then how can it be said i am alone when all the world is here to look on me the wildest hath not such a heart as you run when you will the story shall be changed apollo flies and daphne holds the chase the dove pursues the griffin the mild hind makes speed to catch the tiger bootless speed when cowardice pursues and valour flies ay in the temple in the town the field you do me mischief fie demetrius your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex we cannot fight for love as men may do we should be wood and were not made to woo   ill follow thee and make a heaven of hell to die upon the hand i love so well stay though thou kill me sweet demetrius o wilt thou darkling leave me do not so o i am out of breath in this fond chase the more my prayer the lesser is my grace happy is hermia wheresoeer she lies for she hath blessed and attractive eyes how came her eyes so bright not with salt tears if so my eyes are oftener washd than hers no no i am as ugly as a bear for beasts that meet me run away for fear therefore no marvel though demetrius do as a monster fly my presence thus what wicked and dissembling glass of mine made me compare with hermias sphery eyne but who is here lysander on the ground dead or asleep i see no blood no wound lysander if you live good sir awake do not say so lysander say not so what though he love your hermia lord what though yet hermia still loves you then be content wherefore was i to this keen mockery born when at your hands did i deserve this scorn ist not enough ist not enough young man that i did never no nor never can deserve a sweet look from demetrius eye but you must flout my insufficiency good troth you do me wrong good sooth you do in such disdainful manner me to woo but fare you well perforce i must confess i thought you lord of more true gentleness o that a lady of one man refused should of another therefore be abused you do advance your cunning more and more when truth kills truth o devilishholy fray these vows are hermias will you give her oer weigh oath with oath and you will nothing weigh your vows to her and me put in two scales will even weigh and both as light as tales nor none in my mind now you give her oer o spite o hell i see you all are bent to set against me for your merriment if you we re civil and knew courtesy you would not do me thus much injury can you not hate me as i know you do but you must join in souls to mock me too if you were men as men you are in show you would not use a gentle lady so to vow and swear and superpraise my parts when i am sure you hate me with your hearts you both are rivals and love hermia and now both rivals to mock helena a trim exploit a manly enterprise to conjure tears up in a poor maids eyes with your derision none of noble sort would so offend a virgin and extort a poor souls patience all to make you sport never did mockers waste more idle breath lo she is one of this confederacy now i perceive they have conjoind all three to fashion this false sport in spite of me injurious hermia most ungrateful maid have you conspired have you with these contrived to bait me with this foul derision is all the counsel that we two have shared the sisters vows the hours that we have spent when we have chid the hastyfooted time for parting uso is it all forgot all schooldays friendship childhood innocence we hermia like two artificial gods have with our needles created both one flower both on one sampler sitting on one cushion both warbling of one song both in one key as if our hands our sides voices and minds had been incorporate so we grow together like to a double cherry seeming parted but yet an union in partition two lovely berries moulded on one stem so with two seeming bodies but one heart two of the first like coats in heraldry due but to one and crowned with one crest and will you rent our ancient love asunder to join with men in scorning your poor friend it is not friendly tis not maidenly our sex as well as i may chide you for it though i alone do feel the injury have you not set lysander as in scorn to follow me and praise my eyes and face and made your other love demetrius who even but now did spurn me with his foot to call me goddess nymph divine and rare precious celestial wherefore speaks he this to her he hates and wherefore doth lysander deny your love so rich within his soul and tender me forsooth affection but by your setting on by your consent what thought i be not so in grace as you so hung upon with love so fortunate but miserable most to love unloved this you should pity rather than despise ay do persever counterfeit sad looks make mouths upon me when i turn my back wink each at other hold the sweet jest up this sport well carried shall be chronicled if you have any pity grace or manners you would not make me such an argument but fare ye well tis partly my own fault which death or absence soon shall remedy o excellent yes sooth and so do you fine ifaith have you no modesty no maiden shame no touch of bashfulness what will you tear impatient answers from my gentle tongue fie fie you counterfeit you puppet you i pray you though you mock me gentlemen let her not hurt me i was never curst i have no gift at all in shrewishness i am a right maid for my cowardice let her not strike me you perhaps may think because she is something lower than myself that i can match her good hermia do not be so bitter with me i evermore did love you hermia did ever keep your counsels never wrongd you save that in love unto demetrius i told him of your stealth unto this wood he followd you for love i followd him but he hath chid me hence and threatend me to strike me spurn me nay to kill me too and now so you will let me quiet go to athens will i bear my folly back and follow you no further let me go you see how simple and how fond i am a foolish heart that i leave here behind with demetrius o when shes angry she is keen and shrewd she was a vixen when she went to school and though she be but little she is fierce i will not trust you i nor longer stay in your curst company your hands than mine are quicker for a fray my legs are longer though to run away o weary night o long and tedious night abate thy hour shine comforts from the east that i may back to athens by daylight from these that my poor company detest and sleep that sometimes shuts up sorrows eye steal me awhile from mine own company so methinks and i have found demetrius like a jewel mine own and not mine own and hippolytais all our company here here is the

within his sight for oberon is passing fell and wrath because that she as her attendant hath a lovely boy stolen from an indian king she never had so sweet a changeling and jealous oberon would have the child knight of his train to trace the forests wild but she perforce withholds the loved boy crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy and now they never meet in grove or green by fountain clear or spangled starlight sheen but they do square that all their elves for fear creep into acorncups and hide them there thou speakst aright i am that merry wanderer of the night i jest to oberon and make him smile when i a fat and beanfed horse beguile neighing in likeness of a filly foal and sometime lurk i in a gossips bowl in very likeness of a roasted crab and when she drinks against her lips i bob and on her witherd dewlap pour the ale the wisest aunt telling the saddest tale sometime for threefoot stool mistaketh me then slip i from her bum down topples she and tailor cries and

bear sometime a fire and neigh and bark and grunt and roar and burn like horse hound hog bear fire at every turn my mistress with a monster is in love near to her close and consecrated bower while she was in her dull and sleeping hour a crew of patches rude mechanicals that work for bread upon athenian stalls were met together to rehearse a play intended for great theseus nuptialday the shallowest thickskin of that barren sort who pyramus presented in their sport forsook his scene and enterd in a brake when i did him at this advantage take an asss nole i fixed on his head anon his thisbe must be answered and forth my mimic comes when they him spy as wild geese that the creeping fowler eye or russetpated choughs many in sort rising and cawing at the guns report sever themselves and madly sweep the sky so at his sight away his fellows fly and at our stamp here oer and oer one falls he murder cries and help from athens calls their sense thus weak lost with their fears thus strong made senseless things begin to do them wrong for briers and thorns at their apparel snatch some sleeves some hats from yielders all things catch i led them on in this distracted fear and left sweet pyramus translated there when in that moment so it came to pass titania waked and straightway loved an ass i took him sleepingthat is finishd too and the athenian woman by his side that when he waked of force she must be eyed this is the woman but not this the man then fate oerrules that one man holding troth a million fail confounding oath on oath i go i go look how i go swifter than arrow from the tartars bow captain of our fairy band helena is here at hand and the youth mistook by me pleading for a lovers fee shall we their fond pageant see lord what fools these mortals be then will two at once woo one that must needs be sport alone and those things do best please me that befal preposterously believe me king of shadows i mistook did not you tell me i should know the man by the athenian garment be had on and so far blameless proves my enterprise that i have nointed an athenians eyes and so far am i glad it so did sort as this their jangling i esteem a sport my fairy lord this must be done with haste for nights swift dragons cut the clouds full fast and yonder shines auroras harbinger at whose approach ghosts wandering here and there troop home to churchyards damned spirits all that in crossways and floods have burial already to their wormy beds are gone for fear lest day should look their shames upon they willfully themselves exile from light and must for aye consort with

curst and sad cupid is a knavish lad thus to make poor females mad on the ground sleep sound ill apply to your eye gentle lover remedy   when thou wakest thou takest true delight in the sight of thy former ladys eye and the country proverb known that every man should take his own in your waking shall be shown jack shall have jill nought shall go ill the man shall have his mare again and all shall be well now when thou wakest with thine own fools eyes peep fairy king attend and mark i do hear the morning lark now the hungry lion roars and the wolf behowls the moon whilst the heavy ploughman snores all with weary task fordone now the wasted brands do glow whilst the screechowl screeching loud puts the wretch that lies in woe in remembrance of a shroud now it is the time of night that the graves all gaping wide every one lets forth his sprite in the churchway paths to glide and we fairies that do run by the triple hecates team from the presence of the sun following darkness like a dream now are frolic not a mouse shall disturb this hallowd house i am sent with broom before to sweep the dust behind the door if we shadows have offended think but this and all is mended that you have but slumberd here while these visions did appear and this weak and idle theme no more yielding but a dream gentles do not reprehend if you pardon we will mend and as i am an honest puck if we have unearned luck now to scape the serpents tongue we will make amends ere long else the puck a liar call so good night unto you all give me your hands if we be friends and robin shall restore

pearl in every cowslips ear farewell thou lob of spirits ill be gone our queen and all our elves come here anon either i mistake your shape and making quite or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite calld robin goodfellow are not you he that frights the maidens of the villagery skim milk and sometimes labour in the quern and bootless make the breathless housewife churn and sometime make the drink to bear no barm mislead nightwanderers laughing at their harm those that hobgoblin call you and sweet puck you do their work and they shall have good luck are not you he and here my mistress would that he were gone hence away now all is well one aloof stand sentinelill met by moonlight proud titania tarry rash wanton am not i thy lord how canst thou thus for shame titania glance at my credit with hippolyta knowing i know thy love to theseus didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night from perigenia whom he ravished and make him with fair aegle break his faith with ariadne and antiopa do you amend it then it lies in you why should titania cross her oberon i do but beg a little changeling boy to be my henchman how long within this wood intend you stay give me that boy and i will go with thee well go thy way thou shalt not from this grove till i torment thee for this injury my gentle puck come hither thou rememberest since once i sat upon a promontory and heard a mermaid on a dolphins back uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath that the rude sea grew civil at her song and certain stars shot madly from their spheres to hear the seamaids music that very time i saw but thou couldst not flying between the cold moon and the earth cupid all armd a certain aim he took at a fair vestal throned by the west and loosed his loveshaft smartly from his bow as it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts but i might see young cupids fiery shaft quenchd in the chaste beams of the watery moon and the imperial votaress passed on in maiden meditation fancyfree yet markd i where the bolt of cupid fell it fell upon a little western flower before milkwhite now purple with loves wound and maidens call it loveinidleness fetch me that flower the herb i shewd thee once the juice of it on sleeping eyelids laid will make or man or woman madly dote upon the next live creature that it sees fetch me this herb and be thou here again ere the leviathan can swim a league having once this juice ill watch titania when she is asleep and drop the liquor of it in her eyes the next thing then she waking looks upon be it on lion bear or wolf or bull on meddling monkey or on busy ape she shall pursue it with the soul of love and ere i take this charm from off her sight as i can take it with another herb ill make her render up her page to me but who comes here i am invisible and i will overhear their conference fare thee well nymph ere he do leave this grove thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love   hast thou the flower there welcome wanderer i pray thee give it me i know a bank where the wild thyme blows where oxlips and the nodding violet grows quite overcanopied with luscious woodbine with sweet muskroses and with eglantine there sleeps titania sometime of the night lulld in these flowers with dances and delight and there the snake throws her enamelld skin weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in and with the juice of this ill streak her eyes and make her full of hateful fantasies take thou some of it and seek through this grove a sweet athenian lady is in love with a disdainful youth anoint his eyes but do it when the next thing he espies may be the lady thou shalt know the man by the athenian garments he hath on effect it with some care that he may prove more fond on her than she upon her love and look thou meet me ere the first cock crow what thou seest when thou dost wake do it for thy truelove take love and languish for his sake be it ounce or cat or bear pard or boar with bristled hair in thy eye that shall appear when thou wakest it is thy dear wake when some vile thing is near i wonder if titania be awaked then what it was that next came in her eye which she must dote on in extremity   here comes my messenger how now mad spirit what nightrule now about this haunted grove this falls out better than i could devise but hast thou yet latchd the athenians eyes with the lovejuice as i did bid thee do stand close this is the same athenian what hast thou done thou hast mistaken quite and laid the lovejuice on some trueloves sight of thy misprision must perforce ensue some true love turnd and not a false turnd true about the wood go swifter than the wind and helena of athens look thou find all fancysick she is and pale of cheer with sighs of love that costs the fresh blood dear by some illusion see thou bring her here ill charm his eyes against she do appear flower of this purple dye hit with cupids archery sink in apple of his eye when his love he doth espy let her shine as gloriously as the venus of the sky when thou wakest if she be by beg of her for remedy stand aside the noise they make will cause demetrius to awake this is thy negligence still thou mistakest or else committst thy knaveries wilfully thou seest these lovers seek a place to fight hie therefore robin overcast the night the starry welkin cover thou anon with drooping fog as black as acheron and lead these testy rivals so astray as one come not within anothers way like to lysander sometime frame thy tongue then stir demetrius up with bitter wrong and sometime rail thou like demetrius and from each other look thou lead them thus till oer their brows deathcounterfeiting sleep with leaden legs and batty wings doth creep then crush this herb into lysanders eye whose liquor hath this virtuous property to take from thence all error with his might and make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight when they next wake all this derision shall seem a dream and fruitless vision and back to athens shall the lovers wend with league whose date till death shall never end whiles i in this affair do thee employ ill to my queen and beg her indian boy and then i will her charmed eye release from monsters view and all things shall be peace but we are spirits of another sort i with the mornings love have oft made sport and like a forester the groves may tread even till the eastern gate all fieryred opening on neptune with fair blessed beams turns into yellow gold his salt green streams but notwithstanding haste make no delay we may effect this business yet ere day advancing  welcome good robin seest thou this sweet sight her dotage now i do begin to pity for meeting her of late behind the wood seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool i did upbraid her and fall out with her for she his hairy temples then had rounded with a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers and that same dew which sometime on the buds was wont to swell like round and orient pearls stood now within the pretty flowerets eyes like tears that did their own disgrace bewail when i had at my pleasure taunted her and she in mild terms beggd my patience i then did ask of her her changeling child which straight she gave me and her fairy sent to bear him to my bower in fairy land and now i have the boy i will undo this hateful imperfection of her eyes and gentle puck take this transformed scalp from off the head of this athenian swain that he awaking when the other do may all to athens back again repair and think no more of this nights accidents but as the fierce vexation of a dream but first i will release the fairy queen be as thou wast wont to be see as thou wast wont to see dians bud oer cupids flower hath such force and blessed power now my titania wake you my sweet queen there lies your love silence awhile robin take off this head titania music call and strike more dead than common sleep of all these five the sense sound music come my queen take hands with me and rock the ground whereon these sleepers be now thou and i are new in amity and will tomorrow midnight solemnly dance in duke theseus house triumphantly and bless it to all fair prosperity there shall the pairs of faithful lovers be wedded with theseus all in jollity then my queen in silence sad trip we after the nights shade we the globe can compass soon swifter than the wandering moon through the house give gathering light by the dead and drowsy fire every elf and fairy sprite hop as light as bird from brier and this ditty after me sing and dance it trippingly now until the break of day through this house each fairy stray to the best bridebed will we which by us shall blessed be and the issue there create ever shall be fortunate so shall all the couples three ever true in loving be and the blots of natures hand shall not in their issue stand never mole hare lip nor scar nor mark prodigious such as are despised in nativity shall upon their children be with this fielddew consecrate every fairy take his gait and each several chamber bless through this palace with sweet peace and the owner of it blest ever shall in safety rest trip away make no stay meet me all by break of daywhat jealous oberon fairies skip hence i have forsworn his bed and company then i must be thy lady but i know when thou hast stolen away from fairy land and in the shape of corin sat all day playing on pipes of corn and versing love to amorous phillida why art thou here come from the farthest steppe of india but that forsooth the bouncing amazon your buskind mistress and your warrior love to theseus must be wedded and you come to give their bed joy and prosperity these are the forgeries of jealousy and never since the middle summers spring met we on hill in dale forest or mead by paved fountain or by rushy brook or in the beached margent of the sea to dance our ringlets to the whistling wind but with thy brawls thou hast disturbd our sport therefore the winds piping to us in vain as in revenge have suckd up from the sea contagious fogs which falling in the land have every pelting river made so proud that they have overborne their continents the ox hath therefore stretchd his yoke in vain the ploughman lost his sweat and the green corn hath rotted ere his youth attaind a beard the fold stands empty in the drowned field and crows are fatted with the murrion flock the nine mens morris is filld up with mud and the quaint mazes in the wanton green for lack of tread are undistinguishable the human mortals want their winter here no night is now with hymn or carol blest therefore the moon the governess of floods pale in her anger washes all the air that rheumatic diseases do abound and thorough this distemperature we see the seasons alter hoaryheaded frosts far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose and on old hiems thin and icy crown an odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds is as in mockery set the spring the summer the childing autumn angry winter change their wonted liveries and the mazed world by their increase now knows not which is which and this same progeny of evils comes from our debate from our dissension we are their parents and original set your heart at rest the fairy land buys not the child of me his mother was a votaress of my order and in the spiced indian air by night full often hath she gossipd by my side and sat with me on neptunes yellow sands marking the embarked traders on the flood when we have laughd to see the sails conceive and grow bigbellied with the wanton wind which she with pretty and with swimming gait followingher womb then rich with my young squire would imitate and sail upon the land to fetch me trifles and return again as from a voyage rich with merchandise but she being mortal of that boy did die and for her sake do i rear up her boy and for her sake i will not part with him perchance till after theseus weddingday if you will patiently dance in our round and see our moonlight revels go with us if not shun me and i will spare your haunts not for thy fairy kingdom fairies away we shall chide downright if i longer stay come now a roundel and a fairy song then for the third part of a minute hence some to kill cankers in the muskrose buds some war with reremice for their leathern wings to make my small elves coats and some keep back the clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders at our quaint spirits sing me now asleep then to your offices and let me rest   you spotted snakes with
